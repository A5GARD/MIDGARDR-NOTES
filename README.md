Serving as a public resource hub for several projects that are kept private for reasons that are more or less security minded. As my personal projects are created and continue to be built for my sole purpose only, originially those projects were only posted on the marketplace to ensure that no matter what terminal I may be at, I'll have easy access to my toolset. It was really the first 1500 people that drove me towards creating the docs at first, but in the end I seem to use them just as much if not more than any of the current users due to the projects size.
