#### Item Types

#### Files & Navigation

##### `file`
Quick access to frequently-used files with customizable labels and icons.
- Copy file paths from context menu
- Reveal files in explorer
- Set items as hidden
- Custom icon support via [VS Code icon library](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels)

```json
{ "label": "prisma.schema", "path": "prisma/prisma.schema", "type": "file" }
```

##### `fileAtLine`
Open files at specific line numbers for immediate context.

```json
{ "label": "seed.ts", "path": "prisma/seed.ts:425", "type": "fileAtLine" }
```

**Path Format**: `relative/file/path:lineNumber`

##### `folder`
Organize items into collapsible groups.
- Set as global or workspace-specific
- Configure expanded/collapsed state on startup
- Hide folders when needed
- Add unlimited folders for either global or workspace
- UPDATE: can now create unlimited nested folders, where folders 2 deep would display

```json
{
  "label": "MAIN",
  "expanded": false,
  "type": "folder",
  "global": true,
  "hidden": false,
  "items": []
}
```

##### `url`
Access websites directly from the extensions pane.

```json
{ "label": "Google", "path": "https://www.google.com", "type": "url" }
```

#### Commands & Automation

##### `command`
Execute any VS Code command with a single click. Access 550+ built-in VS Code commands plus 450+ DevStack functions.

```json
{ "label": "SAVE ALL", "path": "workbench.action.files.saveAll", "type": "command" }
```

**Creating Commands:**
- **Custom Input**: Enter any command manually
- **VS Code Commands List**: Browse 550+ built-in commands with descriptions and categories
- **DevStack Commands List**: Access 450+ extension functions (400+ currently have AI-generated descriptions as work in progress)
- Auto-updating command picker that refreshes with each extension build

**Advanced Usage**: 
- Chain commands
- Sequential execution
- Access cheat sheet with 1050+ commands
- Set arguments for commands

```json
{ 
  "label": "Open Settings", 
  "type": "command", 
  "path": "workbench.action.openSettings", 
  "args": ["editor.fontSize"] 
}
```

##### `chain` - Sequential Execution
Execute commands one after another in your specified order. When creating items through the interface, the concurrent/sequential creation process enters a for loop allowing you to add as many custom or listed commands as needed.

```json
{ 
  "label": "Kill Terminals && Start DEV Server", 
  "path": "saveall, killterms, devApp", 
  "type": "chain" 
}
```

**Advanced Usage**: Mixed sequential/concurrent flows, conditional execution

**Preview**: [Video](https://youtu.be/ySp83VqxQ8s) | [Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8an3/dev-notes/blob/main/vfs/SequentialExecution+.gif?raw=true)

##### `concurrent` - Parallel Execution
Run multiple commands simultaneously for maximum speed. Can run alongside sequential commands.

```json
{ 
  "label": "dev:all", 
  "path": "devApp, devCalc", 
  "type": "concurrent" 
}
```

**Concurrent Execution Features:**
- Two execution patterns:
  - **Sequential Execution**: Functions called with `await` for ordered execution
  - **Concurrent Execution**: `await` keyword omitted for parallel execution
- Commands pipe into a single terminal instance with:
  - Distinct color-coded output for each command
  - Interactive terminal for user input (e.g., canceling processes)
  - Terminal remains open as regular PowerShell after cancellation
- All other commands execute in separate environments with persistent terminal instances
- Failed command outputs remain available for review and debugging

**Advanced Usage**: Priority-based execution, resource management

**Enable**: Navigate to extension settings and toggle "Bleeding Edge" to `true`, or set `"ocrmnavigator.CONCURRENT": "bleeding-edge"` in settings

##### `cmdChain`
Chain multiple VS Code or DevStack commands without building several config objects. Takes the value and executes each sequentially.

```json
{ "label": "Quick Setup", "path": "cmd1, cmd2, cmd3", "type": "cmdChain" }
```

#### Terminal Commands

##### `powershellCommand`
Execute commands in Windows PowerShell as if typed directly.

```json
{ "label": "CRM", "path": "code-insiders -n f:/DevStack", "type": "powershellCommand" }
```

**Advanced Usage**: WSL integration, environment variables, complex workflows

##### `debianCMD`
Run commands in Windows Debian WSL terminal environment. Execute programs with pre-programmed flags.

```json
{ 
  "label": "VLC w/ playlist", 
  "path": "cd /mnt/f/music && '/mnt/c/Program Files/VideoLAN/VLC/vlc.exe' playlist.xspf", 
  "type": "debianCMD" 
}
```

**Advanced Usage**: WSL integration, environment variables, complex workflows

**Note**: The ability to set arguments for powershell and bash commands is in development.


#### Utilities

##### `snippet`
Save snippets that copy to clipboard when clicked. Adds to the already included functionality of inline snippet insertion.

```json
{ "label": "Snippet Name", "path": "ocrmnavigator.code-snippets", "type": "snippet" }
```

##### `copyValue`
Place any predefined value into your clipboard.

```json
{ 
  "label": "Copy to clipboard", 
  "path": "Value to be copied into the clipboard", 
  "type": "copyValue" 
}
```

##### `settingsToggle`
Toggle VS Code settings between values. Defaults to toggle between true/false. If provided the args value, toggles through the array one by one.

```json
{ 
  "label": "ARCHIVER", 
  "path": "ocrmnavigator.ARCHIVER", 
  "type": "settingsToggle", 
  "args": ["custom", "vsce"],
  "icon": "settings" 
}
```

```json
{ 
  "label": "NPM Scripts", 
  "path": "ocrmnavigator.vfs.npmScripts", 
  "type": "settingsToggle", 
  "icon": "settings" 
}
```

##### `search`
Open search editors with predefined parameters. Opens in a new tab with context lines, case sensitive by default. Allows multiple search editors at once.

```json
{ 
  "label": "console.log(", 
  "path": "regex pattern to find console.log(", 
  "type": "search", 
  "icon": "search" 
}
```

##### `apiCall`
Execute HTTP API requests directly from the file tree.

**GET Request:**
```json
{
  "label": "Check API Status",
  "path": "https://api.example.com/status",
  "type": "apiCall",
  "icon": "cloud",
  "tooltipText": ""
}
```

**POST Request with Body:**
```json
{
  "label": "Deploy to Production",
  "path": "https://hooks.example.com/deploy",
  "type": "apiCall",
  "args": [
    { "method": "POST" },
    { "body": { "branch": "main", "environment": "production" } }
  ],
  "icon": "rocket"
}
```

 ##### `layout`

[Layout Configuration Guide](./LAYOUT.md)

##### `label`

#### Auto-Generated Items

##### `tasks`
Automatically generated from `tasks.json` when workspace initializes.

##### `npmScripts`
Automatically generated from `package.json` when workspace initializes.

##### `settingsToggle`

- scans workspace settings.json and auto generates items within `SETTINGS` folder placing them in `workspace` so as to not overwrite any items you currently have within the settings folder. The auto generated items will only work for settings that use the values `false` | `true`

> [!TIP] Philosophy: Empowering Developers
> This extension takes an unconventional approach by exposing every internal function directly to you. While this is rare in VS Code extensions, the reasoning is simple: these functions were already built for personal use, and automating their availability helps colleagues and the broader community with minimal additional effort.
>
> Development work involves countless time-consuming repetitive tasks. Unlike some industries where these inefficiencies are unavoidable, software development offers a unique advantage—we can program solutions to our own problems. This extension aims to eliminate those time sinks and help you focus on what matters: building great software.
>
> Getting Started with Chains
> The `chain` type is the most powerful feature in DevStack. It allows you to combine multiple commands into a single workflow, dramatically reducing the steps required for common development tasks.
>
> Example 1: Git Workflow with Version Bump
> This chain automates the complete process of committing, pushing, and incrementing your package version:
> ```text
> type: chain
> path: gitAdd, gitCom, gitPush, bumpVers, gitPush, gitPushTags
> ```
> **Required Component Commands:**
> ```text
> type: powershellCommand
> hidden: true
> path: git add *
> 
> type: powershellCommand
> hidden: true
> path: git commit -m "pushing local data"
> 
> type: powershellCommand
> hidden: true
> path: git push
> 
> type: powershellCommand
> hidden: true
> path: pnpm version patch
> 
> type: powershellCommand
> hidden: true
> path: git push
> 
> type: powershellCommand
> hidden: true
> path: git push --tags
> ```
> Previously, this was run as a single inline command, which had edge cases that caused failures. Breaking it into modular components solved those reliability issues completely.
>
> Example 2: Using Extension Commands
> You can achieve the same result using the extension's built-in commands:
> ```text
> type: cmdChain
> path: ocrmnavigator.gitAdd, ocrmnavigator.gitCom, ocrmnavigator.gitPush, 
>       ocrmnavigator.bumpPatchVersion, ocrmnavigator.gitPush, 
>       ocrmnavigator.gitPushTags
> ```
> 
> The extension automatically detects your package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn) and adjusts commands accordingly.
> 
> ##### Example 3: VS Code Extension Development Workflow
> 
> This comprehensive chain handles the entire build-and-reload process for VS Code extension development:
> 
> ```text
> type: cmdChain
> path: ocrmnavigator.saveAll, ocrmnavigator.killAll, 
>       ocrmnavigator.formatPackageJson, ocrmnavigator.convertReadmeDevMd, 
>       ocrmnavigator.compileWithPackager, ocrmnavigator.installNow, 
>       ocrmnavigator.reloadWindow
> ```
> 
> **breakdoown:**
> 1. Saves all open editors
> 2. Terminates all terminal instances
> 3. Formats package.json files (supports dual package.json setup for automation)
> 4. Converts readme files for pre-processing
> 5. Compiles the extension using either:
>    - **vsce**: Creates local package and publishes to marketplace
>    - **Custom archiver**: Faster compilation with fewer restrictions (supports SVGs in readme, which vsce blocks)
> 6. Installs the extension locally
> 7. Reloads the current VS Code window
> 
> #### Real-World Impact
> 
> The automation possibilities are extensive. For example, my icon library workflow is fully automated—I simply drop an SVG file into a folder, click one button in the DevStack explorer, and walk away. The entire process runs automatically:
> 
> - Icon creation and optimization
> - README updates
> - Project compilation and building
> - Git commit and push to GitHub
> - Version bump
> - NPM publication
> 
> Since my projects are interconnected, I've even created a single button that executes this workflow across all three projects simultaneously.
> 
> Going forward, the extension will embrace a more modular architecture. Previously, functionality was built either entirely in config files or as monolithic standalone functions. The modular approach demonstrated above provides better reliability, maintainability, and reusability.
