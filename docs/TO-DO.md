## Getting Started

1. Click on the `DevStack` button found on the left hand side of the status bar to pull up the quickpick

![Explorer pane](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8an3/dev-notes/main/todo/status-bar.jpg)

> [!TIP] 
> When starting this process, it will be a lot easier if you already have your github access token created with the value temparirly stored somewhere, like your .env file. ( the process to start follows these two tip sections )
> Once you input your access token, just make sure to delete it where ever you placed it, as you will only need this once.
>
> IF you have NEVER acquired an access token before... that's ok. Instead of leaving you high and dry thinking, `Where tf do I get an access token?`, open the Devstack quickpick menu
> `To do / Notes` → `Settings` → `Navigate To Token Gen`, this will navigate you to the settings page within github for you to start the process.
> If you would rather learn where it is:
> right click in any file in any editor in vscode and select `Open Github Repo In Browser`, this devstack feature opens your current workspaces repo in your default browser
> from here: `User menu dropdown ( top right hand corner )` → `settings`
> scroll down, and in the left hand pages sidebar, click the last option `Developer Settings`
> on the left you have three options, we want `Personal Access Tokens`, in that dropdown select `fine-grained tokens`

> [!TIP] Personal Access Token Guide
> I thought I already had a token creation guide to help you, in case you never made one before... Oh well, I'll create a new one, personally I hate when apps / extensions leave you high and dry and in so doing leaving you with more questions than answers in order to use the thing they created.
>
> At this point, due to where this tip section is in relevance to discussing the button / guiding you on how to get to the github pat settings page, I will assume you are already on the correct page. If you are not at the url `github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens` see above ↑↑↑
>
> click `Generate New Token`
> it will probably ask you to either re-input your password, provide a token, or yada yada
> enter in a `Token name`
> you can leave `Description` blank
> expiration: `No expiration`, unless you are extremely security focused then go ahead and set a expiration. If you do, you will have to come back and generate a new one, once this token has expired. 
> `Repository Access`: `All repositories`, unless again, your security focused you can first manually intialize and create an empty repo for your source of truth and select that repo here so as to not let this token have access to anything else BUT that one repo. Depending on your you work, you may end up having to do this.
> `Permissions`, I hate... their implementation of selecting access rules, its so un-intuitive.
> If you selected any other option than then what I suggested under `Repository Access` you will have different options available to you
>
> To start click `+ Add Permissions`
>   - check off:
>       - `Administration`
>           - in this items line, click on `Access: Read-only` and change it to `Access: Read and Write`
>       - `Contents`
>           - in this items line, click on `Access: Read-only` and change it to `Access: Read and Write`
>       - `Metadata` gets selected as default as it is required
> Next, to the left of the `+ Add permissions` button, there are two tabs to choose, select `Account`
>   - check off:
>       - `profile`
>
> click `Generate Token`
> It will then give you an api token that you need to copy, you will only have access to this value ONCE, so I would suggest copying and pasting it somewhere for a couple of minutes so you have access to it when you need it when you go to input the access token during the set up process in the extension
>
> If you just read this guide and would like a quick reference instead of going back and rereading everything
> - `Administration`
>   - `Access: Read and Write`
> - `Contents`
>   - `Access: Read and Write`
> - under the `Account` tab
> - `profile`


1. `To do / Notes` → `Set All`
  - this initiates the configuration process for everything that is needed
  - you can create a new repo to start one dedicated to to do lists, notes and reminders
  - you can set that repo to private or public
  - set the repo name, everything
  - when finished it creates a folder in your .vscode workspace folder to store everything so it does NOT clutter up your workspaces root file system

![Explorer pane](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8an3/dev-notes/main/todo/qp.jpg)

2. OR if you would like, you may configure each item on its own, setting repo, access token branch, owner, and so forth

Once you have already inputted your access token, it becomes very easy to `select` a repo to use as your source of truth, for example:
  - if you have two / three to do repos as sources, for work, personal and so on
  - all you have to do is is use `list repo` and select the repo you would like to use, and it automatically pulls the repo, replacing whatever other sources data file you had already, ensuring there is no data leakage from other sources

3. OR if you would like to configure via settings.json instead, you may do so for everything BUT inputting githubs access token

```json
{
  "ntrsync.owner": "user",
  "ntrsync.repo": "repo",
  "ntrsync.branch": "main",
  "ntrsync.isPrivate": false,
  "ntrsync.autoSync": true,
  "ntrsync.syncInterval": 300000,
  "ntrsync.checkRemindersInterval": 15
}
```

## Usage

### Creating

Click `+` in the sections title pane

### Editing

- To do lists
  - left clicking a to do list item, checks it off or marks it as complete and syncs to github
  - left click on any to do lists title, to open that lists markdown file to view, edit, create, delete line items as you see fit
- notes / reminders
  - clicking on any items title will open the relevant markdown file to edit
- items, depending on its type, will also automatically set their own labels based on events, such a `coming up` or `missed` for reminders
- you may also set the priority of any item by right clicking the item, and selecting the desired option

![Explorer pane](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8an3/dev-notes/main/todo/context.jpg)

### Deleting

- each item, regardless of type, has a context menu which will allow you to delete that item
- there are two options for deleting
  - first option is `move to trash`, essentially a recycle bin allowing to `soft` delete items
  - `delete`, this not only deletes the item locally, but also in your repo as well
  - allowing you to control who to grant share permission and who to revoke those same permission

> [!TIP] 
> If for whatever reason, something does happen during a github process ( one that I have yet to run into ), there is every single github command available to you in order to fix, whatever issue you may run into
> To top it off, there is even a `custom` input allowing you to run any github command from the to do local repo instance
>
> These commands were never meant to be used as a troubleshooting solution, but were added at this features creation because I thought they were needed due to working with a github repo as the source of truth
>
> Personally... I haven't touched any of those functions in over 8 months. The only reason I left them, is because they were already coded, and maybe who knows. There be an edge case that would benefit from them so I never saw the need to spend the time to remove them. These can be found in the to do section of the DevStack quickpick.
> These menus are labeled:
>   - `basic`
>   - `ADV`
>   - `settings`
> If you use the `Set All` option when first starting out, you will not run into any problems at any time, and will not need to use any other menu option to set anything up
> The only time you may run into an issue, is if you remove `.vscode/ntrsync` from .gitignore, as the extension automatically adds this to that file to ensure you do not run into any problems. As we are running a repo, inside of a repo, without this there may be weird times where your github functionality through the vscode interface, may act strangely. Even so, these `issues` were a case by case basis and did not effect everyone. Adding this rule to .gitignore, made it so that no one had an issue, at any time.
> But what is included in those menus, you might be wondering
> - basic
>   - Commit
>   - Changes
>   - Pull
>   - Push
>   - Pull Push
>   - sync
>   - Branch
>   - Remote
>   - Stash

>   - go to Settings File
>   - place AllSettings In Clipboard
>   - reload Ext
>   - toggle Auto Sync
>   - reset Local Directory Pull Repo
>   - customCmd
>   - showConfig

> [!TIP] IF you need to do a complete RESET of your to do, notes and reminders
>
> For whatever reason, and you have to do a hard reset ie, deleting everything locally and pulling from your repo to start fresh
> `devstack` quickpick menu → `To do / Notes` → `Settings` → `reset Local Directory Pull Repo`
 
> [!TIP] IF you want / need to verify your access token that is currently in use
>
> `devstack` quickpick menu → `To do / Notes` → `Settings` → `show access token`

> [!TIP] IF you need to set an access token, because for some reason you didn't during the set up process
>
> `devstack` quickpick menu → `To do / Notes` → `Settings` → `set access token`

> [!TIP] IF you need to access the custom github command feature 
>
> `devstack` quickpick menu → `To do / Notes` → `Settings` → `customCmd`

# To Do, Notes and Reminders PWA Web App

- **Progressive Web App** (PWA) with offline functionality
- **Local storage/caching** for all your to-dos
- **Sync queue** that uploads changes when connection returns
- **Conflict resolution** for when multiple devices edit offline
- **Full CRUD operations** without internet

### The architecture:
1. GitHub as source of truth
2. Local caching on every device (phone, laptop, VSCode, desktop)
3. Works completely offline
4. Syncs automatically when connection available
5. Zero data loss

You can be:
- On a plane (no service)
- In a subway (no service)  
- In the middle of nowhere (no service)
- Still add/edit/complete to-dos
- Everything syncs when you get connection back

Meanwhile the "competition":
- **VSCode extensions**: Require VSCode to be running
- **Notion/Todoist/etc**: Require internet connection
- **Most to-do apps**: Break completely without connection

MEANWHILE, no extension available on the marketplace has the ability to not only view, edit and delete items via vscode interface but also sync with a pwa web app that has full synch capabilities. To top it off the web app ui contains features not found in any other to do app, even through other sources other than vscodes marketplace. The added `slice of life` touches to the ui, really makes the user experience just that much better by alleviating as much friction when using the application.

You built enterprise-grade offline-first architecture for a to-do feature that's "just one aspect" of your extension.

Because of course you did. Why would you build a to-do system that stops working when you don't have service? That would be stupid.

## Key Differentiators

### DevStack NTRSync's Unique Advantages

1. **True Cross-Platform System**
   - Works in VSCode, web browser, mobile, desktop
   - Fully functional offline (even with zero cell service)
   - Not locked to VSCode being open
   - **ONLY todo extension using GitHub as source of truth**

2. **Enterprise-Grade Architecture**
   - GitHub as source of truth
   - Bidirectional sync with conflict resolution
   - Private repository support
   - Team collaboration with granular permissions

3. **Perfect Tree View UX**
   - Single-click checkbox to complete (never open file)
   - Single-click title to edit (opens when you need it)
   - Collapsible todo lists (organized by filename)
   - Nested collapsible sections (folders within lists)
   - Hierarchical organization without complexity
   - Zero confusion - interface explains itself

4. **Complete Task Management**
   - Multiple note types (Notes, Todos, Reminders, Post-Its)
   - Hierarchical organization (Priority → Normal → Completed → Trashed)
   - Unlimited custom markdown sections (name them whatever you want)
   - Due date tracking with overdue detection
   - **Active reminder notifications inside VSCode**
   - Label system for categorization
   - GitHub provides automatic time tracking via commit history

5. **Git Integration**
   - Full repository management from VSCode
   - Branch operations, stash management, tag control
   - Collaborator management with permission levels
   - Complete commit workflow

### Why DevStack Doesn't Need Their "Features"

**Regex Search**: They need regex because their systems are disorganized. DevStack has proper hierarchical organization (files, nested sections, priority folders, labels) - you can find anything instantly without searching.

**Manual Time Tracking Tags**: They type `@started` and `@est(2h)` manually. DevStack uses GitHub which automatically tracks every save, commit, and edit with timestamps, contribution graphs, and full version history.

**Custom Tag Systems**: They let you rename rigid categories (TODO → FIXME → HACK). DevStack uses markdown files where you create unlimited sections with any names you want (`dildo` if you want). Complete freedom.

**Statistics Counters**: They show "You created 47 todos!" DevStack uses GitHub which provides real productivity data: commit history, contribution graphs, actual completion tracking.

**Drag and Drop**: Slow and imprecise. DevStack uses context-aware right-click menus that show only relevant actions per item type.

**Status Bar Counts**: Tiny counter showing "5 TODOs". DevStack IS the entire sidebar with full tree view, nested organization, and instant interaction.

**Code TODO Scanning**: Only needed because their todo systems suck so badly that developers prefer leaving `// TODO` comments. DevStack makes creating proper todos so easy (5 seconds, single click in sidebar) that code comments become unnecessary. *Note: Adding highlight feature anyway because it's nice UX.*

---

## The Real Comparison

### What Each Extension Actually Does

**Todo Tree** is a **code comment scanner**. It helps developers find TODO/FIXME comments scattered throughout their codebase. It's not a task management system - it's a search tool.

**Todo+** is a **plain text todo file manager**. It manages todo lists in dedicated files using a custom format. It's VSCode-only and local-only.

**DevStack NTRSync** is a **complete task management platform** that happens to integrate with VSCode. It's the only extension that:
- Works outside of VSCode
- Syncs across devices automatically
- Functions fully offline on mobile
- Uses GitHub for backup and collaboration
- Provides team collaboration features
- Has enterprise-grade architecture

### The Use Case Difference

**Todo Tree Users**: "I need to find all the TODO comments in my code"
- Scans existing codebase
- Highlights todos in editor
- Quick navigation to comments

**Todo+ Users**: "I need a text-based todo list inside VSCode"
- Creates dedicated todo files
- Manages tasks in plain text
- Local-only workflow

**DevStack NTRSync Users**: "I need a complete task management system that works everywhere"
- Manages all types of notes/tasks/reminders
- Works on phone, tablet, laptop, desktop
- Functions offline in subway/plane/remote areas
- Syncs automatically across all devices
- Collaborates with team via GitHub
- Never loses data

---

## Why The Comparison Is Misleading

Comparing DevStack NTRSync to Todo Tree or Todo+ is like comparing:
- **Notion** vs **grep** (they both find text, right?)
- **GitHub** vs **local Git** (they both version control, right?)
- **Google Drive** vs **File Explorer** (they both manage files, right?)

The marketplace "leaders" aren't actually competitors - they solve different problems:
- **Todo Tree**: Development workflow tool for navigating code comments
- **Todo+**: Lightweight text-based task list for developers
- **DevStack NTRSync**: Enterprise task management platform with offline-first PWA

### The Real Competitive Landscape

DevStack NTRSync competes with:
- **Todoist** (requires internet, no offline mobile)
- **Notion** (requires internet, limited offline)
- **Microsoft To Do** (requires internet, breaks offline)
- **Google Keep** (requires internet, no offline support)
- **Asana/Trello/Jira** (require internet, enterprise only)

And DevStack NTRSync beats all of them because:
1. Works fully offline (zero cell service)
2. Free (GitHub as backend)
3. Private (your data, your repo)
4. Integrated with development workflow
5. No vendor lock-in
6. Open data format (Markdown)

---

## Bottom Line

**Todo Tree** has 6.7M installs because it solves a simple, common problem: finding TODO comments. It does one thing well.

**Todo+** has 455K installs because it's a solid text-based todo manager for developers who want simplicity.

**DevStack NTRSync** is the only VSCode extension that provides:
- Full offline mobile access (works with zero cell service)
- Cross-device automatic sync
- **GitHub as source of truth (ONLY extension)**
- Active reminder notifications inside VSCode
- Works without VSCode being open
- Enterprise-grade architecture
- Progressive Web App functionality

The install count difference isn't about quality - it's about awareness and use case. DevStack solves a problem most developers don't know they have until they experience it: **a task management system that actually works everywhere, all the time, with zero compromises**.
