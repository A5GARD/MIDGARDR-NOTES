### VSCode Extension Configuration Testing Suite

Are you creating an extension for vscode?
Are you sick and tired of microsofts shit documentation, or lack of rather.
Are you sick and tired of not know what does what exactly while creating your extension and blindly firing off configuration values, then only relying on warning or error logs?

Well fear no more

### JSON File Formatting and Validation

I haven't had much luck with formatters in the past tbh, but I have been using this foramtter for a while now without issue. I will revisit the formatter configurator at some point to re create the underlying functionality of it as it is not in the best condition currently. At that time, I will make the json/jsonc formatter configurable as it is not in its current state. As I'm assuming not many people will enjoy the current settings that it was coded with as it turns multi line objects into single line. For some reason I seem to be one of a few who opt for this configuration. IF you are one of those few, enjoy! 

This is now available to be configured as a default formatter for the json and jsonc file type with vscode.

Format JSON/JSONC files and toggle error checking.

**Available Commands:**

**Formatting:**
- `ocrmnavigator.formatCurrentJsonFile` - Format Current JSON File (converts multiline to inline)
- `ocrmnavigator.formatPackgeDevJson` - Format package.dev.json
- `ocrmnavigator.formatGlobalNavigatorConfigJson` - Format Global Navigator Config JSON

**Validation Toggle:**
- `ocrmnavigator.toggleJsonValidation` - Toggle JSON error checking
- `ocrmnavigator.toggleJsoncValidation` - Toggle JSONC error checking

**Usage:** Create DevStack item with type `command` using these command IDs, or access via DevStack Quick Pick

### Zombie Process Killer (portReaper)

Kill processes running on specific ports to free them for your dev server.

**Access:** DevStack Quick Pick → VS Code → Zombie Process Killer

**The Problem:**
```
Error: EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

**Old Solution:**
```bash
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
```

- Custom port number input option
- One-click port clearing

### Auto Zombie Process Killer

Automatically detect and kill processes blocking your dev server port.

**Access:** DevStack Quick Pick → VS Code → Auto Zombie Process Killer

**How It Works:**
1. Scans package.json for your dev script
2. Extracts port number from dev script
3. Runs shell script: `fuser -k 3000/tcp` (or cross-platform equivalent)
4. Automatically clears the port

**Features:**
- Automatic port detection from package.json
- No manual port entry needed
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Instant port clearing

### The ".env" Context Swapper (envProfile)

A zero-error environment configuration system that eliminates manual .env editing and ensures your app never breaks from typos or misconfigurations.

**The Problem:**
Manual .env editing is error-prone and tedious. Switching between development and production requires commenting/uncommenting multiple variable sets across microservices—one typo breaks everything.

**The Solution:**
Automated environment switching with a single click. No manual editing, no commenting, no errors.

**How It Works:**

**File Structure:**
- `.env` - Active configuration file (auto-generated, never edit manually)
- `.dev.env` - Source file containing all environment variable pairs

**Variable Format:**
Each environment variable has two versions prefixed with `LOCAL_` or `REMOTE_`:

```env
LOCAL_environment='development'
REMOTE_environment='production'

LOCAL_DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:Ch3w8acca66@localhost:5432/catalyst"
REMOTE_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_mfHjL51BCRlg@ep-solitary-glade-adoppzpt-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"

LOCAL_SESSION_SECRET='9k7mN2pQ8xR4vL6wE3tY1zH5jC0bF8dG7aS4nM9qK2uI6oP3vX8wR1eT5yH7jN0m'
REMOTE_SESSION_SECRET='9k7mN2pQ8xR4vL6wE3tY1zH5jC0bF8dG7aS4nM9qK2uI6oP3vX8wR1eT5yH7jN0m'

LOCAL_UI_CHECKOUT='/Catalyst/UI/code/list/all'
REMOTE_UI_CHECKOUT='/Catalyst/UI/code/list/all'

LOCAL_PADDLE_CLIENT_TOKEN="live_79e842b9aee2a289dc3431d8967"
REMOTE_PADDLE_CLIENT_TOKEN="live_79e842b9aee2a289dc3431d8967"

LOCAL_PADDLE_SERVER_TOKEN="pdl_live_apikey_01k4v3y240x0t4v8t39ytj7swr_yAAtEFKtVdpaYCqYHVBvyt_Aln"
REMOTE_PADDLE_SERVER_TOKEN="pdl_live_apikey_01k4v3y240x0t4v8t39ytj7swr_yAAtEFKtVdpaYCqYHVBvyt_Aln"
```

**Missing Values:**
If either `LOCAL_` or `REMOTE_` value is missing in `.dev.env`, the variable is still included in `.env` but set to empty:

```env
DATABASE_URL=""
```

**Quick Switch Interface:**
Built-in quickpick with two options:
- `Set Local .env Var's` - Switches to development configuration
- `Set Remote .env Var's` - Switches to production configuration

**Safety Guarantee:**
The system always reads from `.dev.env` and writes a complete `.env` file, regardless of current state. This idempotent approach ensures the configuration never enters an invalid state.


### Intelligent JSON Schema Support
The extension includes a powerful schema-driven engine that provides deep IntelliSense and automated workflows for JSON and JSONC files. By detecting the $schema property in your files, it provides context-aware assistance tailored to your specific data structure.

#### ✨ Key Features
Smart Autocomplete:

Booleans: Instant suggestions for true/false.

Enums: Automatically lists all allowed values defined in the schema with their descriptions.

Numbers: Suggests default values and displays minimum or maximum constraints directly in the completion list.

Context-Aware Path Detection: High-accuracy logic to determine your exact position within nested JSON objects, ensuring suggestions are always relevant to the current key.

Quick Fix Code Actions: Use Cmd+. (Mac) or Ctrl+. (Windows) on a value to quickly swap between enum members or toggle booleans without typing.

Schema Caching: Optimized performance through a local cache, ensuring the UI remains snappy even when working with large or complex schemas.

Deep Schema Support: Correctly resolves complex schema structures including definitions, items, and anyOf blocks.

#### 🛠 How it Works
Detection: The engine looks for a "$schema": "./path/to/schema.json" entry in your JSON file.

Parsing: The SchemaParser extracts all possible fields, types, and constraints.

Mapping: As you move your cursor, the extension calculates your "JSON Path" and matches it against the parsed schema to provide the right suggestions at the right time.

#### Commands

- ocrmnavigator.clearSchemaCache
  - Clears the internal schema cache. Useful if you have updated your schema file and want to see the changes immediately.

### VSCode Commands reference
- available via devstack quickpick and click on vscode cmds
- features 1800+ vscode settings to be used within settings.json files
- when a settings.json key has been clicked, copies that key into your clipboard

### VSCode Commands reference V2 Dynamic
- available via devstack quickpick and click on vscode cmds dynamic
- the biggest difference between this and v1 is that this list is dynamically fetched, and when clicking on a key instead of just copying that key to your clipboard to be pasted into your settings.json file, it will open another menu with all of the values relative to that key, then once one of these key : value pairs bas been clicked it will copy the pair into your clipboard to be pasted into your settings.json file
- due to it being dynamic, till its tested thoroughly I do not know how reliable or stable it will be which is why v1 will remain an option in the menu as those options are hardcoded, and has been extremely reliable obviously
