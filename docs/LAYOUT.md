# Layout Configuration Guide

#### The Workspace Layout Engine, a sophisticated orchestrator that allows you to define and switch between entire development environments with a single click. It doesn't just change a theme; it reconfigures the entire VS Code UI, opens your project files in specific grid positions, and prepares your terminal environment.

Designed for developers who switch contexts frequently—moving from heavy feature development to a focused debugging session or a minimal writing environment. It automates the tedious process of rearranging your editor every time you start a task.

This guide explains how to configure custom workspace layouts using the DevStack layout system. Each layout defines how VS Code appears when activated, including UI elements, editor tabs, terminals, and color themes.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> **Major Update: Complete Rewrite**
> 
> This feature has been completely rebuilt from the ground up—not because anything was broken, but to make it even more powerful and configurable.
>
> If you're already using this feature, you'll need to replace your current configuration. I know that sounds like a hassle, but the improvements make it worthwhile.
>
> **New Capabilities:**
> - **Cloud sync**: Access your configurations remotely from anywhere
> - **Profile management**: Save configuration profiles directly from VS Code and push them to the web UI
> - **Easy sharing**: Log in via GitHub (using the same email) to download your profiles on any machine
> - **Team deployment**: Perfect for managers who want to standardize workspace setups across their team
>
> These features make onboarding new developers incredibly efficient—you can have their entire workspace configured instantly. Whether you're setting up different configurations for new hires or helping your current team optimize their development environment, this system has you covered.

 
> [!NOTE] 
> **New Configuration Parameters:**
>
> - **default** → `true | false` (unchanged from previous version)
>
> - **keybindings** → Configure custom keyboard shortcuts per configuration. Use the same key combinations in different contexts, workspace-specific shortcuts, or any mapping you can imagine.

>   - `"onLoad"` - Runs every time the workspace loads
>   - `"onReload"` - Runs when the workspace reloads

## Configuration Approachs

#### The quick and dirty method
For simple theming and basic layout control, you only need to configure the `workbench.colorCustomizations` and / or `workspace` object. This serves as a central location for any VS Code setting values. Place your customizations in either the `workbench.colorCustomizations` or `workspace` sections (or both), and you're done.


#### For ALOT more granular control
This guide takes a modular approach: a brief overview followed by detailed exploration of VS Code's key-value pairs.

Each collapsible section includes multiple examples demonstrating different approaches—T-bone layouts, 4×4 grids, 1×1 configurations, and more. These examples are followed by real-world implementations with inline comments explaining the purpose of each setting.

I've structured each section to mirror either VS Code's native configuration patterns or the conventions already established by this extension, minimizing the learning curve.

> [!TIP]
> **For Beginners & Those New to Configuration Files**
>
> If manual configuration feels overwhelming, that's completely normal. Start small: create a few items in your main config and get comfortable with the basics before diving into more complex setups. Remember, even the most intricate configurations are just individual config items added one at a time.
>
> **Safe Configuration Workflow:**
> 
> 1. **Always backup first** - Copy your config file (or the entire extension folder) to a safe location before making changes
> 2. **Edit your backup copy** - Use this as your testing playground
> 3. **Test your changes** - Close VS Code, copy your edited config to the extension folder, then reopen VS Code
> 4. **You're protected** - If anything goes wrong, you have a working backup to restore
>
> This backup-first approach eliminates 100% of the risk. If you make a mistake or miss a few lines during copying, you can simply restore from your backup.
>
> **A Note on Learning from Source Code:**
> 
> Early in my coding journey, I spent considerable time exploring node_modules. While most developers will tell you never to modify dependencies (and they're right for production code), there's immense learning value in experimenting with copied source code.
>
> By working with copies of libraries—modifying them, extracting specific functionality, or adapting features from older versions—I developed crucial skills that most developers lack: the ability to navigate and understand others' code quickly.
> 
> Reading other developers' code teaches you new patterns and techniques you'd never discover on your own. You'll frequently encounter clever solutions that make you think "that's brilliant" and expand your own toolkit. While many developers avoid reading others' code because it's challenging (especially across multiple files with complex execution flows), mastering this skill:
>
> - Frees you from being locked into specific libraries or versions
> - Gives you access to an unlimited learning resource
> - Develops a rare skill that makes you valuable to employers
> - Accelerates your learning exponentially
>
> Even experienced developers who don't currently do this should consider it. The ability to dive into any codebase and understand what's happening is what took my own development skills to the next level.

## Example Configs

> [!NOTE] 
> Due to time constraints, I'll admit that in order to provide the descriptions for every single settings key:value pair they were fed through an ai prompt.
>
> At some point I will come back to go over all of them, redoing any that warrant the need to. But I'm currently going into the 7th hour since I started working, and the only thing I have done so far is this doc and there are other things that I NEED to do. Everything has a description as promised, and what is my half ass attempt at providing a settings.json resource and cheating all the descriptions through ai. As an end result, is a resource that you cannot find anywhere else in terms of depth and just how broad of a spectrum in different areas that the settings control. Not to mention going over settings, that no one else even mentions. I just remembered I still have the theme section, and because of the processes I use with my theme builder, I cannot have the ai provide this section. So I will finish that before moving onto other matters.

I truly wish vscode was developed differently because I have made the layout engine a dozen times over with trying to manipulate the ui in all manner of ways. 
      // I knew when I started, that this was an option, but everywhere you read up on configuring the ui they always state to use other methods that are just unreliable with ui manipulation due to not having access to its current state. As most of the functions that manipulate the ui... are toggles. There are a couple of areas, in which I can garauntee the value, unfortuantly the other 90% of values you simply cannot. 
      // For example, there are a couple of toggles that force the ui no matter what because that toggle, uses vscodes context in order to see what its current state is ie, if you wish to use zen mode like I do, zen mode virtually toggles off every ui component aside from your editors. Because of that, from a progmatic aspect, I now know with 100% certainty what the values are for the sidebar, secondary sidebar, statusbar, panel and so on. 
      // With that knowledge and how you would like your layout to look, I can now safely toggle those values. When my layout loads, once it enters zen mode, it then toggles back the sidebar, secondary sidebar, activity bar and status bar so that they are all displaying in zen mode. 
      // With saying that, the layout engine assumes you are in default configuration at load time: 
      // - primary sidebar open
      // - activity bar open
      // - status bar open
      // - panel open 
      // - and due to copilot the secondary sidebar open
      // - the editor group doesn't effect the layout engine because it's first function that runs is to close all terminals and editor groups, allowing it to start with a clean state
      // For 99% of you this will be the default state in which vscode opens, with the odd power user being left out. Even for the odd user that is left out, it is a very easy fix. Which means, when you load vscode you are 100% good to go. If you plan on activating a new layout mid session, just ensure that the ui is in that default state before clicking on that layout item. 
      // Personally, I hate how this relies on the user to ensure the current state of the ui because whenever I code any function I try to remove as much as I can from the user having to do any one thing, BUT the cost is outweighed by a large margin in respect to what you gain out of its functionality. Yes, you have to ensure your panel is open before and if it isn't it can either be 2 clicks or a shortcut and a click to open, so 2 user actions. Whereas, when the engine is activated it controls a series of events that would take you an hour or more if done manually. 
      // Pretty huge benefit over the cost of doing business, and this is the only time I have ever been ok with adding a step for the user to do something in order for a function to work. 
      // In terms of THIS config, if I were to manually do this every time... it would be hours each time as my config has been continously modified over the span of years. Previously I made the ui to serve all purposes and sitations, but now I can have a different ui set up for each and taylor the ui to fit my current coding needs which that was something I refused to do due to the cost of time in setup. All in all, before this engine was created I was happy enough to no longer look for an alternative to vscode. The layout engine, was definitely the missing puzzle piece I did not know was missing to really get the most out of it and be happy with my working enviroment, as imo this feature should be included in vscode as a default, because I know there are power users that work at microsoft who would love this level of control and not just power users but any user that has created a theme for vscode, so why is it not provided as a default?
      // If your someone who would like to learn more about key:value pairs in one place instead of scouring page after page of blogs and docs, I will go over that in the next section as promised.

## settings.json key:value pairs

**Configuration Guide Structure**

This guide is divided into two main sections:

1. **Settings Overview** - Comprehensive walkthrough of available configuration options
2. **Theme Builder** - A streamlined approach to creating consistent, professional themes in minutes instead of hours

I've also developed a theme builder tool that dramatically simplifies what has traditionally been an unnecessarily complicated process.

**About This Resource**

While I don't claim to cover every available setting (VS Code has an extensive configuration surface), I'll walk through the majority of commonly used options that I've thoroughly tested and understand.

**Why This Guide Exists**

When I first explored VS Code customization, I struggled to find comprehensive resources. Most guides cover a handful of settings, leaving you to piece together information from scattered blog posts, incomplete documentation, and trial-and-error experimentation.

My own research process included manually walking through the `settings.json` file—triggering IntelliSense on new lines and activating each setting individually to see what it controlled. This took hours, but uncovered valuable customization options that aren't well-documented elsewhere.

**A Real Example:**

The default syntax highlighting in editors and gutters can be visually overwhelming. I couldn't find any resources explaining how to customize this. Eventually, I found a single mention of the parent setting category, which led me to manually test each related key until I achieved the clean interface I wanted.

This guide aims to save you from that same tedious process by consolidating what I've learned into a single, practical resource.

<details closed><summary  style="font-size: 1.4em;  color: #1447e6;">settings.json</summary>

This section covers settings from both the configuration file and my global settings, organized by parent key for easy reference.

Due to the extensive amount of content to document, this is a work in progress. Any missing descriptions will be added in future updates.


<details closed><summary  style="font-size: 1.2em;">performance</summary>

This object within the config, is either going to be LARGE or small for you, depending on a couple of factors. 

The first being extensions, they play a role whenever I look at changing the performance when I notice a considerable dip in how my instance performs. AI engines have a huge crux attached to them whenever you install one, in terms of background processes. In which I always tend to turn them off to the point now that if I were to download a new extension that features ai I immediatly open the settings to disable almost everything to the point that the only way that the ai can function is through a manually triggered event.

Almost forgot about this because my vscode expereience is vastly different from the average user. At some point the average user will experience a dip in performance due to extensions. I know everyone will, purely based off of the fact on just how many blog posts there are in troubleshooting this area. 

Unfortuantly, I have not read a single blog post that was correct in the information that they were providing in this dept. When I first started to try to solve these issues, I took their information as gospel and did exactly as what they outlined. Over time and learning more about vscode itself when I started to create extensions, that was when I learned exactly what the issues were due to. The dip in performance you are experiencing is NOT because of just how many extensions you are installng, it is due to how the extensions were coded couple with how vscode itself was coded. 

VSCode underlying code is built on electron and if you have ever looked at the current options to build an app in windows you will VERY quickly get told, repeatedly, that electron uses the most and in huge amounts of resources in windows in comparison to literally every other offering. 

So... we aren't starting off on the best foot, it's like starting a marathon when you weigh 350 lbs vs 125 lbs. 

NOW, this issue compounds when you have devs, who are trying to be smart and look cool, by offering features in extensions that have a ton of background processes running and doing god knows what. Multiplied by the 10-15 extensions you have running at any given time the second you start vscode. Meanwhile, all those extensions, I garauntee it, not only have the same base functions running as background process which all produce a base line result in needed to function the way they do, which from an effeciency aspect is horrible considering if those same amount of extensions were built as one, instead of the same 15 background processes, it could one but I digress. To make matters worse, the rest of their code probably isn't executing in the best ways possible, because they created it they looked at it as I have one feature so performance probably didn't even enter their thought process before publishing that extension. 

Up to this point in summary, we have a application that was built on the wrong platform, then we have extensions that run a bunch of shit in the background, to be completely honest probably don't even need to be running if they were built right, those same extensions were built without the thought process of performance in mind before they were done. And it doesn't end here... 

VSCode as a default gets shipped with some features, obviously. 

Github being one of the features, if you work in larger workspaces turning this off will net a huge return in performance. As you do not need to constantly be checking to see exactly what folder, file, files line number and so on is different locally compared to your repo. 

Next there are the language engines that are CONSTANTLY running, and get triggered with every key stroke and file opening event. For example, my package.json and readme.md files within this project suffered MASSIVELY from these background processes. Before I found the settings needed to optimize vscode in this regard, modfying these two files became impossible. In my package.json, I couldn't fold any region or object having to wait 1-3 mins, actually, before I could fold anything anytime I made a single change. Scrolling through my package.json was a pain due to stuttering. Now I imagine, the issues I experienced with my package.json will be very few and far between in terms of your experience because of the file size. Currently sitting at 37,000+ lines, I wouldn't be surprised if there is less than 1% that will get to that size.

My readme.md file was suffering so horribly from performance issues, I could no longer use vscode to edit that file. Pressing delete, and actually having the event register in the editor, was more than 60 seconds. Any other keystroke, was between 15-30 secs depending on what was going on at that time. Which you can imagine was such a fucking pain. Thankfully, my current config has fixed all issues that I have experienced up to date albeit it was a very painstaking process in order to figure out and in the end it was a stroke of luck to finally be able to edit markdown docs in the editor again. 

And it was such a pain because, no one... and I mean no one, goes over this topic in any form... that is correct with the information they provide... microsoft doesn't even go over this topic and how to optimize vscode from a performance aspect. To get to the solution, it was literlly walking through every single setting, activating it by setting a value, then testing it to see if it made a difference, then going back and moving on to the next one. I wish you could just turn the engines off, but unfortuantly you can't disable all of them.

The second you may never even experience, because it comes down to workspace sizing we touched on it earlier but I'll go into it in more depth. If you never code a larger project, you will never experience huge stutters where vscode is rendered unsuable to the point where you cannot even click on anything while the background processes play catch up when opening certain files. This extension alone was what prompted the feature `performance switch`. Thankfully to date I have tuned my settings enough where I don't currently have a reason to use it as much as I have, but as this continues to grow I will probably have to resort to it again because the settings will only go so far.

If you do code in larger projects, I don't know the exact file count but lets say more than 2500+. This count does NOT include any files found within node_modules, build output folders and such. Stating that number, I'm counting the files that you would actually would have touched in some form or fashion rather it be manually or automated through your own custom scripts. I know it is less dependant on line and word count because:
- while this extension hosts all the same code, practically, that my components ui library hosts x2 ( because there more than one function that deals with that library and unfortuantly do not use the same obj ) 
- ONTOP of that, all the other files that are used for the rest of the extension 
- PLUS also hosting all the functions code to insert shadcn components
- I have 2 icon libraries worth of data, because I haven't cleaned out the first that I removed functionlity for when I got sick and tired of that library and created my own
- there are 2 different version of referencing vscode commands, but one of the lists is generated by scanning your vscode instance and presenting that list ensuring, without my help, you always get an up to date list no matter how many version updates vscode gets, the other list was manually created and will consist of 3500+ line items
- you already know the last one, hosting all the code for 125+ extensions including documentation

To say that vsce prompts me with warning after warning due to extension size would be an understatement because, I remebmer VERY early in this extensions developemnt see that prompt. It runs better then so many other extensions that just host one feature, so I don't know what it's problem is.
Anyways, this workspace doesn't suffer from this issue while my components library does. It has a TON more individual files, but this extensions code has more lines of code. Which indidcates vscode doesn't have an issue with total lines per file, unless its a json file with 35,000+ lines, but it starts to have an issue based on total file count due to opening every single file and scanning it for god knows what bullshit its trying to figure out.

Now we can negate these performance losses in several ways, because if it weren't for these optimizations, YOU WILL SEE THAT PERFORMANCE TANK way before 2500+ files. 

BUT obviously there is a trade off, and it comes down to what can you live without in terms of features. Personally, I value performance at the number 1 or 2 spot. I'll go over every single value once we get to the list but as for a quick breakdown based off of memory:
- you can live without your github repo, constantly updating on whether your local repo is dirty or not and by how many files and lines of code its dirty by, IF this is a concern of yours... just use the layout engine to push data at workspace close. At which point, if you also configure it to pull at workspace initialization... you will never have to worry or do anything in the git explorer pane ever again, essentialy I will be 'hiding' that tab in the activity bar moving forward to have it completely removed from my thought process. Hopefully, the next conversation with a dev in regards to git, I'll just respond, 'huh, wtf are you doing in git? I haven't touched that in years. Oh, your just a muggle who has to manually go and work that...' 
- disabling codelens
- disabling intellisense
- disabling lightbulb
- disabling auto import helpers ( I haven't had the best luck in creating a replacement for vscodes implementation purely because of performance reasons. With the layout engine out of the way, this will get back on the list of things to do. When its available, you hammer out your code and forget about importing anything, once that file is done trigger the function ( that way there isn't some stupid background process running and eating up unnecessary resources, I understand why they shipped the product with this as a default feature. But what I don't understand is, why didn't they ship a manually triggered version of it ), and that function will auto create all of your import statements at the top of the file )
- disabling validation and or disabling other unimportant baseline features and their engines
- in terms of using the search features within vscode, we will go over this in detail, setting a baseline in what is exlcuded from your results... will produce a massivaly more effecient searching event. Not only will the events duration decrese drastically, but if you don't set that baseline you can see a performance drop in other areas of vscode if you were to just let that search run while you continue to code 
- it truly boggles my mind why vscode does this, I think I found a solution for this but theres no way to actually test this though but anwyways disabling the auto preview of markdown docs. WHENEVER you are in a markdown document... vscode, whether or not you have the md render preview tab open beside it or not, will alwalys be rendering markdown content as if that preview tab was open... whyyy... that's such a stupid thing to fuck up on. Yes, for small markdown docs this won't even enter the thought process of a dev to consider this to be an issue, or even become one. For larger projects or larger markdown files, this will be an issue especially if you do not even have the preview open
- inline suggests of any kind and all types
- almost forgot this one, excluding files from watcher
- inline with the previous, but a lot more agressive to the point where I imagine less than 1% of devs will use it, files.exclude which exludes whatever values you place in here in its entirety to the point where it will not even display in the explorer pane when you are viewing files and folders

Now you may have noticed, that I didn't mention things like, disabling updates, disabling auto updating extensions and so on. This is because, these are events that trigger once and are done. These types of features, you don't have to worry about UNLESS you are experiencing massive initial load times. At which point, disable these types of features. And before you even think of it, yes... I HAVE found the setting to turn off the annoying toasts asking you if you would like recomendations from the extensions or projects creator whenever you open a project, I don't know why those bother me so much.

If you reach this point, congratulations! Seriously, now you have learned something that over 90% of devs do not know and who continue to provide advice even though, not one thing they stated was correct. Whenever I say things like this, I'm not putting down anyone in any way, everyone has different learning journeys and experiences based off of ones motivation and there are all manners of people at every different level. But whenever I see someone do something or learn something that the majority does not, I want you to be aware of that so you can feel good about it. But I would be lying if I said I wasn't annoyed and mad spending hours and hours researching, ONLY to find out that I couldn't trust 99% of the blogs that mention vscode, lol. That's the only reason I'm spending so much time on this, atleast NOW there is one source out there that is correct and will take the time to go over information, no one else will. 

<details closed><summary style="font-size: 1.2em;">How it is that this extension features the same level of functionlity of more than 100+ functions?</summary>

At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if you were asking yourself just how it is that this extension features the same level of functionlity of more than 100+ functions? After reading the above text, you may have noticed a theme in the occurance of issues that every user will face with vscode, as I have yet to meet a single user that has not installed more than 10 extensions. Some users will hit that performance wall earlier than others, in some instances I've seen it happen in the single digits. 

I've said this before, and I have no problem or shame admitting this, there were a couple of events that took place that were just shear luck. If it wasn't for those events, this extension would be no where near where it is today. Other then those events, and because I experienced these same performance issues that we talked about. Whenever there was a feature or function that I wanted, my thought process going into it was different then the average dev. I actively tried to NOT introduce any background processes into the code.

The only background processes that are currently within the code, across the entire codebase, only run once, these actual functions cannot be triggered again or by any other feature, and once they receive the values they are looking for, they're done by placing them into a extension wide context. Going off of memory alone,
- initializes the main part of the extension and all the values that are needed throughout each function across the entire codebase which include:
  - extension settings configured by the user
  - it grabs the value of the current logged in user, typcally the same email as github
  - does a couple of minor checks to the website, just comparing the email to see if you currently subscribing
  - it intializes the snippets, since these are workspace context
  - combines your workspace config and your global config
  - and in short, intializes a couple of other classes used for hovering and others
The only functions that are `active`, are reaction based. Which means, they aren't scanning anything they just sit there and wait for an event to trigger them. And I try to limit these to the absolute bare minimum.

With saying, it was only recently that, virtually, the entire extension was re-developed. Before that, the performance was still in a state of `exceeds expectiations`. Then when I decided to bite the bullet and strap in to redo the code, it was not only a complete redesign, but also covered a large area. Where as, the new code effects every single aspect of the extension. The performance increase... is insane. I never thought it would be able to get to its current level, even if it had half the features. 

The reason that warranted the redesign was, this entire extension was built one feature at a time. Let's be real, if anyone told you they were gonna build this as an extension, you would respond with, `What have you been smoking today?`. Because it was built piece by piece, the code was not effecient when you take a step back and look at it. Most features were requesting the same new values, each time a feature was used. There was no sharing of any kind or in any form between features. There was no prioritizaion of when functions loaded, not to mention every single feature, aside from helper functions, honest to god, was entirely in the extension.ts file. For the LONGEST time, I was paranoid about moving the features into their own files because when I wasn't as experienced whenever I did move a feature, it broke.

While it still performed great, in comparison to others, it got to a point where I just couldn't take it anymore in terms of performance. Initial loading time, I know I'm probably being anal about this, was just too long. Before I even started, I already knew I had one massive hurdle that could not be solved, which is because the partnering site is hosted on vercel ( Don't get me wrong or take this the wrong way when I say this one critisism about vercel, because after trying 10's of platforms. I truly beleive vercel to be one of the best, in virtually every aspect. I do not see a day, where I would use another provider in its place in terms of hosting a site. ) if the site isn't used for 15 minutes I think, the server goes into hibernation mode, and it takes a WHILE for it to come back online. With that one request to the site, it slows the entire intialization down. 

I solved it by prioritzing what loaded when, when the extension gets activated. Ever since I learned about this, I try to employ every chance I get. It's kinda like a cheat that googles snapchat used for uploading. From the user perspective, whenever you uploaded a photo, and inserted the caption and filled in the other fields, once the user pressed done or upload, the progress bar would just shoot across the page really quickly. While at first glance, they had upload times that... couldn't even be imagined by their competition, that's how much faster they were. What the user didn't see though, was as soon as you selected the photo to upload, before the user even went to type in a caption it was already uploading the picture to the database. By the time the user was done with the caption, in reality, the upload process was already done on the back end. When the user clicked done, the only data being transfered, was text data at that point. If the user canceled or backed out, they just deleted the picture off of the server.

Trying to emulate the same result, because the likelyhood of you clicking on a file tree item within the first 5 secs of it loading is so low that, no user will be clicking on it that quickly when vscode loads as there is a 1000 other things to click on in the ui. When the file tree loads in the sidebar it isn't entirely loaded to the point where it is actually in a useable state. You can even test this, if you were to click on a file tree item within the first 3-4 secs of it loading, it won't actually work. But if you didn't know this, you would just think it loaded extremely fast. While the other 13 extensions you have with one feature each, are bogging your system down.

As far as the redesign goes, that's the only smoke show as far as how it works with the code. All the other areas that were re-created were from the ground up and from an entirely new perspective. Everything in the redesign is no longer built with the idea of adding a new feature, instead the thought process was how can we code it in a way where every feature moving forward as well as all of its current features work as one in harmony instead of a `last man standing` basis. I also looked at how much can be removed from everything, to be replaced by the one function to rule them all.

Terminals: this was a fucking disaster when looking at it from this perspective. As each and every single instance a termnial was used... it was creating a brand new terminal. Not only did making one terminal engine, class, or whatever you want to name it, streamline all the terminals used through out the extension. It opened up the door for new functionality, like the layout engines idea was derived during the making of the terminal engine, giving user the ability to configure WHERE terminals actually open, and the list goes on and on. The most noticeable difference is, now whenever you click on several functions over a period of time, they will continue to use the same terminal over and over. Coupled with, a feature that no one else even has the chance to offer. With starting dev servers, because all the terminals are created through a single source, whenever you click on start dev server within the file tree, it first checks to see if there is a terminal instance already open, if it is and is currently running, it checks to see if it is running the same dev server commmand. If it is, it progmatically sends `ctrl + c` through to the terminal, proceeded by starting the new dev server. If there is a dev server already, but isn't the same, it then creates a new terminal and running the server command, so as to not bottle neck users who need more than one dev server running at any one time.

VFS provider: Before now, each item type was indivdually coded which was a pain, because it had to be coded in several spots and if any one aspect of the code was off by one in any of the spots, it wouldn't work. All of that was removed, in place there is one single `item` being created in the code base, which ultimately allows for a lot quicker prototyping of new items and testing of new items as well, as there is nothing really to do, virtually. A couple of items are now auto generated, to npm scripts, tasks, snippets... I know theres atleast one more... ya, in your settings folder, all of your currently available settings that are in your workspace file are also auto generated. Which removes the work load of you creating them. Especially when it comes to snippets, I'm always looking to improve that ux, since my first experience with them was so horrible. Another feature that, like lets be real, is unusable till you reach a certain level of knowledge in coding. 

I remember wanting to use that feature, trying it for hours, getting frustrated and just dropping it, not to touch it again for MONTHS. Which is why this extension has the same, probably higher, feature parity as enterprise / paid solutions. If you look at it purely from a ux perspective, no other snippet related feature / extension / app even comes close. I went from, creating a snippet... once every 5 minutes if I was lucky. To now being able to create the snippet and its config item, in under 12 secs from start to finish. Not to mention all the other new feautures that were recently added.

Feature / function execution: In its previous version, every feature executed its own items, in their own ways. From a maintainable view, is horrendous due to them being located all over the place. Now, a class was created specifically for that. To be honest, a version of that class has existed for a long time now, but was never really used due to just how far and wide spread all the functionality was. When you think about it, it is literally the same as coding 100+ individual extensions, in every aspect. To the point where I strived to create features, making the ux so intuitive and simple and coding it in a way where anyone who uses it, would get it. So as to not having to write long docs... like this one. The ONLY reason I'm spending the time on this... is because there is no other. I know because when I was experiencing these issues, the resources I did find, weren't that great, most blogs were a carbon copy of eachother stating the same things over and over again, and microsfts docs are so shit and because I was pretty new to coding, I could NOT make sense of them, not a single fucking thing made sense when I read those docs. Another great feature provided by microsoft that requires a certian level of experience in order to use. And I'm also the type of person to go out of my way to help people, despite the fact that, even to this day, this extension is built for the sole use of my own and it will continue to do so. The only reason I have put the effort into the other sections of the docs, was for my personal use only. The amount of times, I finished coding a feature and then go to the docs to create the readme section, only to learn that... I added last week. Or the amount of times, I use my own docs because I haven't used a feature for 2-3 months and forget how it works, lol, there are THAT many features in this extension.

You can thank claude for the improved docs, seriously. As this extension becomes more rediculous, and when I do use ai to help with certain parts of it and help me code more effeciently. There has been so many occasions, where it freaks out, shocked that the extension does what I state when prompting it to code a part of a feature in order for the new feature to fit in. Each time it asks, what else does the extension do, at which point it freaks out even more. Telling me that I'm not selling it enough, or why I'm not trying to go after users, and so on. 

Concurrent / chain: Chain hasn't really seen an update for a LONG time now. As each item type works flawlessly with it, and in my configs it is the most used item type. Concurrent on the other hand, just got ANOTHER redesign with the others, at the same time it also received new features. If you have a concurrent command that contains both powershell and bash commands, no matter how much you have of either type, it only opens two instances. One for powershell and the second for wsl debian, and all of the commands pipe through their respective instances while at the same time you have the ability to interact with each instance. If you were to run 10 dev servers in each, each dev server will output in its own color. If you were to press `ctrl+x`, it would send that kill command to all of its child instances, killing each dev server properly.

All in all, it was NOT a small task... and I'm still dealing with it even today. Take this doc for example, if it wasn't for that update this would have never got added. The end result, a much better code base to continue adding features all the while, you the user, experiences a much faster extension to work with. And don't worry, I am not even considering stopping in terms of adding features, or even updating the ones it already has. As I am always improving the ux, and due to the reasons why I even started coding, that will always be at the forefront of my focus, because I too use this extension. So much so that, the primary sidebar, is now on the right side and the extension occupies the left sidebar now. It gets that much more use, and honestly if microsoft wanted to steal and add it or most of it as a default, I wouldn't even be mad I would just say something along the lines of, about time... only took you 10 years. EVEN today I added a feature, in which I'm asking myself, how is this not a default feature since you already have and use the same functionality in other places in vscode. The ux of the new search editor I just added... my god, I can't wait to try it after I'm done this because I see myself using parts of it so much and will 100% replace all search functionality that vscode currently provides. Speaking of which, I truly hope you enjoyed learning about what we went over, and use this knowledge at some point in your future but due to the amount of things gone over, I would suggest re reading it again in the future. This is a self improvement tactic, that I only ever see the very best do, no matter the field that they are in. I too employed this tactic for years when I was in sales, I'm not contributing this one thing to my success in sales because, even at risk of sounding like an asshole douchebag, I was literally the best no matter where I work, or what field I was selling, even if I had no idea what it actually was I was selling. The reason being is that, the next time you read this, you yourself will be a different person. When you re-read it, you will pick up on things that you either missed the first time, or you will obsorb and interpret things different which will give you a whole new perspective when you take in what you are reading. Because there are parts of this doc, that honestly took my coding game from 4 and launching it past 10. I've even had one dev, yell at me telling me that I'm a liar for almost an hour, when I responded to the question of how long I've been programming for, lol.

> [!TIP]
> To help you work with the global and workspace settings files, there are 2 shortcuts in the devstack quick pick menu. Whenever clicked it will open them in your current editor.
>
> To take it a step further, I have also placed shortcuts for your global devstack config AND your active workspaces config. It is on the to do list, but there will ALSO be an option when creating config items, to create a file type item that will direct you to that workspaces config file. Allowing you to enter each workspace, and create an item based off of that workspaces config file.
>
> I have thought about, instead of only creating that object based off of the current active workspace, but to provide a list of options. The only issue I see with the second option is that, in order to provide a human readable list, the function would first have to go into each workspace, grab the id from the .vscode folder and then at the same time also go into your package.json and grabbing that projects name so that you know why option is refrencing what project, performance wise that may not end up doing well. The ssecond issue is, while I store all of my workspaces in one folder I know not every dev does that, so unless I code it so you choose a folder to scan it probably won't materialize.

  // To be honest, and imo, it is a setting that is only viable for use with the layout engine or an extension with similar features. Because to get the most out of it, you have be pinning commonly used files, by not adopting the process of pinning files, setting this to true is just way too agressive for users.
  // BUT, if you properly set out a list of files to open and pin in your editor groups, this one feature is so awesome. 
  // It cleaned up a part of my workflow that I didn't even know there were options to do just that.
  // what it does: any file that is not currently being actively viewed, or pinned... closes. 
  // ie, you have been coding for an hour and 15 minutes and just below your menubar among your pinnned files you have open, you have 5-15 other files open but dirty or in other words, not saved. If you were to trigger save all, those same 5-15 files would automatically close once they are saved. Which is awesome because now, you no longer have the menial cleaning task of going through all your open tabs and individually closing them, every 2-3 hours or if you don't do it for the day or depending on what exactly you are editing that day, you may have more than 100 tabs to go through.

  // But each introduction of an ai engine in your vscode instance, introduces VERY VERY heavy workloads. It is so bad, that if I were to install an extension knowing it has ai features before I even use vscode in any way, I'm taking an axe to that extensions settings. As you can see from the following settings, copilot is pretty much completely disabled unless I manually trigger an event. 
  // When releasing `prompt`, to prove just how effective it is in solving 99% of the issues you face with ai prompts. I downloaded, I want to say about 15-20 extensions solely featuring ai as a prompt. All of them, without exception, had inline code features, they all had the ai engine scanning not only your currently opened file but also your entire project, ALL the time, and the background process features don't end there. 
  // So if you were looking for good options, in terms of installing an ai prompt into your instance, these are my recomendations. I experienced all manner of issues and problems when using such a broad spectrum of extensions because I essentially downloaded every single option that was available at the time. If you install an option that isn't listed below, you will probably face atleast one issue before you actually end up using the ai prompt.
  // Funnily enough, the options below, except one other but is so bad I won't even mention it, were the only options that did NOT have some sort of issue in order to use it. There were extension where I went to sign up for an account in order to get the api key, I couldn't sign up in any way even after visiting their main site and manually trying to sign up. There were A LOT of issues with api keys. There were also times that even after doing everything the docs stated, it just didnt work. 
  // There is one listed below that you need to watch out for, unless you speak mandarin which is `codegeex`. I do not fucking speak mandarin, and had to learn it just to use it. At the time, and even today, it makes me laugh that an extension required me to learn a new language in order to use it. We all know, being tech people, how to navigate to a menu, and atleast access the setting to change it to the language you need in order to use it. I could not for the life of me find the setting while it was in mandarin, and I searched for well over 20 minutes for it. ONCE, its in english I liked using it the most.
  // There will be an ai prompt associated with this extension that will be available soon, its already coded and will be released soon. If you want to take advantage of all the benefits `prompt` offers, while adding literlly 0 steps to your day to day workflow with ai prompts while coding, keep an eye out on the site for it. This will be the best ai prompt for devs... period. Not only does prompt get results so good, I would rather use it in its current manual form, then not. Coupled with a ux design, not featured anywhere else that was developed solely for the a developers benefit. So in short not only does it improve your prompts success better then any other product, paid or not, but also removes any and all pain points in using any prompts ui.

This is one of those settings that, really made a feature I did not care for, to actually loving it. This controls exactly, and I mean exactly how wide the minimap is to the pixel. If you do not use the minimap currently because it just takes up too much real estate, try this out because once you set it to 50 or below, it becomes small enough where it is worth while having. Coupled with changing to which side it resides on to left, that pairing of settings was the game changer that made me love the minimap feature because when you have two editors side by side, and your cursor is in the middle, with in a 50px span you can control, both files. When your actively coding, your cursor tends to be on the left side of the editor, making it a short distance to access the current files editor, if it isn't already within 100 px's of it. Changing the size to fill, was also a huge plus, as well as auto hide set to true and showslider set to mouse over, so as not to impede on the overall esthetic, or another way to look at it is, its one less thing that is visually trying to get your attention, we will discuss the last point more in themes.

  // The following settings I credit to really optimizing my vscode instance, I think. It was a day that I was really frustrated, and was trying out different settings WHILE still actively coding. I beleive these are the final settings due to the fact that, while I didn't notice it that day due to anger managment issues, the days following my vscode instance went from `fuck this` to how is everything... just working. And I have not touched them since. Because out of all the settings in that file, these are the ones that are performance based. If you haven't already noticed settings, that are not mentioned anywhere else on the internet but here, you will in this section. I would say about half of the values I use were discovered from painstakingly using intellisense on every line and manually going through and toggling everything. Literally every single form of issue I was experiencing, has vanished while at the same time, keeping features I never imagined I was going to be able to use when deciding to keep them from a performance perspective.
  // - i still have either codelense or lightbulb, cant remember which but one of the two
  // - still have inline snippets
  // - still have validation active for a lot of different file types
  // in short, there is now not a single feature where I'm thinking, "I wish I had that"

I do not know why, microsoft shipped a product with a feature where, so many people WILL want to use it. Depending on your level of experience, its a feature so horribly developed... its unsuable till you reach a certain level of knowledge, actually. 

One thing microsoft is the absolute best at, is developing the absolute worst ux bar none. And due to the resources they have at their disposal, no one can ever take this crown from them. 

I won't get into the reasons why, but one night I actually calculated, at global scale, how much time microsft wastes in terms of `time wasted per user, per day` using their products on a day to day work basis. The result was so horrible, I measured it in human years wasted, so a full 24 hours a day, 365 days a year wasted. In the same length / distance ( sure, we'll use that in this instance ) in time for me to experience day to day interactions... with dinosaurs, actually standing among and breathing the same air they are, is how much time... microsoft wastes if it isnt yearly, because I think its yearly its been a while, then it would be every 5 year cycle. EVEN if its every 5 years... that is truly insane. I could experience the birth of christ 1000's of times over and still have time on the clock to spare, I'm not religious so another example would be, I could break bread and on a philosophical level, argue with socrates, plato and aristotle as they live and breath about all matter of things... where I could visit them for dinner every single day of my life, coming back to present day for the remainder, and still have time on the clock. That would be kind of fucking cool actually, but it sounds rediculous and absurd and if you think I'm exaggerating, I kid you not, due to nature of compounding numbers along with calculating it at a global scale they waste a rediculous amount of our time as a provider. And when I did the calculations, I was so reserved in terms of actual time wasted per person per day, that I knew with 100% certainty that I was below the average used to calculate this. I won't calculate it again now because I remember it was not easy. If you do want to calculate it yourself, because it is an eye opening exercise, you have get the totals for... I want to say either outlook or 360 active accounts, the gaming division, I think there was one other statistic you needed, but anyways the numbers are very hard to come by but you can get these values.

ANYWAYS, to come back around, if you are a new dev, I highly suggest ( and I don't do this often ) to stop here, and come back later down the road. I'm not going to leave you high and dry. If you go to the theme builder you can build an amazing looking theme in less than 5 mins no matter your experience level because I removed the settings key:value pairs out of the equation when creating a theme for vscode. 

All you do is select the primary color, border color and foreground color, and click on copy to clipboard. Then the only step needed at this point is, pasting it into your .vscode/settings.json file in the `workbench.colorCustomizations` object like how it is below, and you too can have a custom built theme.

For the more experienced devs, in terms of theme builder and just how it does that exactly. I configured the same theme builder I used for tailwind themes, but had the color converters also provide the same values for "categories" of vscode settings. After grouping them up to apply colors accordingly, it turned a stupid headache of a process, into a exercise I have zero issues doing at any one point in time. If this isn't a process you hate doing and somehow you enjoy doing it currently, by organizing the values by category it will save you a huge amount of time instead of going through, line by line and setting each color value since there are so many. I will include the actual function to do just that after the settings
