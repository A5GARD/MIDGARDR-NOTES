I stopped looking for VSCode alternatives. Not because VSCode is perfect. Because DevStack made it perfect. 45 projects. 20,000+ lines of configuration. One seamless environment. This is what VSCode should have been.

### The Problem Every Developer Knows

You can have **features** or you can have **performance**. Pick one.

Before DevStack, I maxed out at 13-15 extensions before VSCode became unbearably slow. Every new tool meant choosing what to disable. Every project had different needs but the same limited toolset.

### The Solution Nobody Else Built

DevStack consolidates 100+ essential development tools into **one unified, zero-conflict extension** that runs **faster than 13-15 traditional extensions combined**.

But here's what makes it revolutionary: **context-aware configuration switching**.

**Real-World Usage:**
- ✓ 45+ workspace-specific configurations
- ✓ Each workspace: ~450 lines of custom commands
- ✓ **20,000+ total lines** of configuration managed effortlessly
- ✓ Commands **automatically load** when switching workspaces
- ✓ Faster performance than 13-15 basic extensions
- ✓ Zero manual configuration switching
- ✓ Zero conflicts between workspace setups
- ✓ The only extension to reference all 1500+ vscode cmds ( in addition to the `docs` or reference, each cmd is also selectable during the items creation process, presented categorically, partnered with a search function and descriptions )
- ✓ In addition to the vscode cmds, this extensions 2500+ cmds are ALL available for any user to use

### Versatile Toolkit

A comprehensive suite of item types designed with one principle: **empower users to do what they need, when they need it—without arbitrary restrictions.**

### Navigation & Files
- **File Navigation** - Jump directly to any file at a specific line number
- **URL Launcher** - Open websites instantly from your workspace
- **Markdown Files** - Quick access to documentation and notes

### Command Execution
- **VSCode Commands** - Execute any VSCode command with custom flags and arguments tailored to your workflow
- **Extension Commands** - Full access to every command from your installed extensions
- **PowerShell Commands** - Run PowerShell scripts with custom flags and parameters
- **Bash Commands** - Execute in Windows WSL Debian environment with zero restrictions
- **Command Chains** - Sequentially execute any combination of item types in any quantity
- **Concurrent Command Execution** - First to intelligently group concurrent commands by shell environment (PowerShell + Bash), piping each group into their own single color-coded terminal while keeping them interactive for user input.
- **VSCode Command Chains** - Streamlined chaining specifically for VSCode and DevStack commands with minimal setup

### Clipboard & Snippets
- **Copy to Clipboard** - Instantly place any value in your clipboard without creating snippets
- **Snippet Manager** - Copy snippet bodies directly to clipboard for quick insertion

### Automation & Integration
- **Settings Toggle** - Switch between setting values (boolean or custom arrays) with a single click—no need to open `settings.json`
- **Tasks** *(Auto-populated)* - Automatically scans `tasks.json` and creates executable items in a dedicated folder
- **NPM Scripts** *(Auto-populated)* - Auto-generates items from `package.json` scripts in its own organized folder
- **API Calls** - Execute HTTP requests to test APIs with configurable methods, headers, and body payloads
- **Concurrent Execution** - Run multiple commands simultaneously for complex workflows

### Design Philosophy
Every item type was created to maximize flexibility and minimize friction. No needless restrictions. No artificial limitations. Just powerful tools that adapt to your workflow, not the other way around.

**Each project gets exactly the tools it needs. Automatically.**

### Core Systems

### Virtual Filing System (VFS)
**The only shortcuts system with intelligent, seamless configuration merging.**

#### Intelligent Configuration Architecture (Completely Unique)

**The Problem:**

Most developers work on multiple projects simultaneously:
- Personal projects vs. work projects
- Frontend vs. backend vs. DevOps
- Different frameworks, different tools, different workflows

Traditional extensions give you two bad choices:
1. **One massive config** - Cluttered with commands you don't need in current context
2. **Manual switching** - Tedious, error-prone, breaks your flow

**DevStack's Revolutionary Solution: Seamless Config Merging**

**How It Works:**

1. **Global Config** - Universal commands available everywhere
   - Git operations
   - File management  
   - General VSCode commands
   - Your personal workflow tools

2. **Workspace Configs** - Project-specific commands
   - Framework-specific shortcuts
   - API endpoints for this project
   - Build/deploy commands
   - Project-specific utilities

3. **Automatic Merging** - DevStack combines them seamlessly
   - Open any workspace → DevStack instantly merges global + workspace configs
   - **Appears as ONE unified tree view**
   - **Completely transparent** - you can't tell where global ends and workspace begins
   - **Zero configuration** - happens automatically
   - **Instant switching** - no lag between workspaces

**Real-World Production Stats:**
- **45+ workspace configurations** actively managed
- **~450 lines per workspace config**
- **20,000+ total configuration lines**
- **One seamless, unified experience**
- **Zero manual config switching**
- **Faster than 13-15 basic extensions**

#### The User Experience

**What You See:**

Open "Frontend-React-Project" → See one unified command tree with:
- Your global git shortcuts
- Your global file operations  
- React component insertion commands
- Tailwind styling shortcuts
- This project's API endpoints
- This project's build commands

Switch to "Backend-Node-API" → Instantly see one unified command tree with:
- Your global git shortcuts (same ones)
- Your global file operations (same ones)
- Prisma database commands
- API route generators
- This project's test runners
- This project's deployment scripts

**You never think about "global vs workspace."** You just see the commands you need, when you need them.

#### Real Production Example

**45 Active Workspaces, Each Unique:**
```
Frontend Projects (12 workspaces)
├── React + Tailwind shortcuts
├── Component library commands
├── Styling automation
└── Preview & deployment tools

Backend Projects (15 workspaces)  
├── Prisma database commands
├── API generation tools
├── Testing frameworks
└── Server deployment

Full-Stack Projects (10 workspaces)
├── Combined frontend + backend
├── Monorepo management
├── Coordinated deployments
└── Full-stack testing

DevOps Projects (5 workspaces)
├── Docker commands
├── CI/CD pipelines
├── Infrastructure tools
└── Monitoring setup

Documentation Projects (3 workspaces)
├── Markdown tools
├── Diagram generation
├── Publishing workflows
└── Content management
```

**Every workspace:** Different tools, different workflows, different commands  
**Every switch:** Instant, automatic, seamless  
**Every experience:** Unified, fast, intuitive  

**20,000+ lines of configuration. Feels like one.**

#### Why This Architecture Is Revolutionary

**Traditional Extensions:**
```
You: *opens Project A*
Extension: *loads commands from config.json*
You: *opens Project B*  
Extension: *still shows Project A's commands*
You: *manually edits config or switches profiles*
Extension: *reloads, breaks flow*
```

**DevStack:**
```
You: *opens Project A*
DevStack: *instantly merges global + Project A config*
           *shows unified tree*
You: *opens Project B*
DevStack: *instantly merges global + Project B config*  
           *shows unified tree*
You: *never even noticed the switch*
```

**It Just Works.™**

#### Technical Capabilities

**Execution Modes (No Other Extension Has Both):**

**Concurrent Execution:**
- Run multiple commands **simultaneously**
- Perfect for parallel build processes
- Start dev server + watch mode + type checking simultaneously
- Massive time savings on complex workflows

**Sequential Execution:**
- Run commands **in order**
- Wait for each to complete before next
- Perfect for dependent operations
- Build → Test → Deploy pipelines

**Mixed Mode:**
- Combine concurrent AND sequential in same workflow
- Example: Start 3 servers concurrently, then sequentially run tests
- Ultimate flexibility

**Shell Integration:**
- Execute **any PowerShell command** with full flags
- Execute **any Bash command** with full flags
- Mix VSCode commands + shell commands in same sequence
- Non-restrictive shell environment
- True automation power

**Timing & Control:**
- Configurable delays between commands
- Precise execution timing  
- Conditional execution (run command B if command A fails) - *coming soon*
- Variable substitution (workspace paths, file names, environment vars)

**Scale Without Limits:**
- Unlimited commands per workspace
- Unlimited workspace configs
- Proven stable: 45 workspaces × 450 lines = **20,250 lines**
- Search finds anything instantly
- Zero performance degradation

### Real Talk: This Changes Everything

**The Old Way (Every Other Extension):**
```
Morning:
08:00 - Open frontend project
08:01 - Realize you have backend shortcuts loaded
08:02 - Edit config file, comment out backend commands
08:03 - Reload VSCode
08:04 - Finally start working

10:00 - Need to switch to backend project
10:01 - Edit config file, uncomment backend, comment frontend  
10:02 - Reload VSCode
10:03 - Back to work

12:00 - Quick fix on DevOps project
12:01 - Context switch overhead
12:02 - Edit config AGAIN
12:03 - Reload AGAIN
12:04 - Fix takes 30 seconds, context switching took 3 minutes
```

**The DevStack Way:**
```
Morning:
08:00 - Open frontend project → See frontend commands + global tools
10:00 - Open backend project → See backend commands + global tools  
12:00 - Open DevOps project → See DevOps commands + global tools

Total time thinking about config: 0 seconds
Total reloads: 0
Total frustration: 0
```

**This is the difference between:**
- Managing configuration vs. building features
- Fighting your tools vs. tools serving you
- Hobby project vs. professional workflow

**From:**
- 13-15 extensions max (performance ceiling)
- One bloated config serving all projects
- Manual config switching breaking flow
- Scrolling through irrelevant commands
- Limited to ~50 commands before breaking

**To:**
- 100+ tools in one extension
- 45+ specialized configurations  
- Automatic, seamless switching
- Only see commands you need
- 20,000+ commands managed effortlessly

**One extension. Zero compromises. Infinite scale.**

That's DevStack.

## The Problem DevStack Solves

### The Old Way (Every Other Extension):

```
Morning:
08:00 - Open frontend project
08:01 - Realize you have backend shortcuts loaded
08:02 - Edit config file, comment out backend commands
08:03 - Reload VSCode
08:04 - Finally start working

10:00 - Need to switch to backend project
10:01 - Edit config file, uncomment backend, comment frontend
10:02 - Reload VSCode
10:03 - Back to work

12:00 - Quick fix on DevOps project
12:01 - Sigh deeply
12:02 - Edit config AGAIN
12:03 - Reload AGAIN
12:04 - Fix takes 30 seconds, context switching took 3 minutes
```

### The DevStack Way:

```
Morning:
08:00 - Open frontend project → See frontend commands + global tools
10:00 - Open backend project → See backend commands + global tools
12:00 - Open DevOps project → See DevOps commands + global tools

Total time thinking about config: 0 seconds
Total reloads: 0
Total frustration: 0
```
