# Select: Create Config File
```

Or create it manually:

```jsonc
// catalyst.config.jsonc
{
    "theme": "blue",                      // presetting the theme
    "preset": "MODERN",                   // presetting the preset
    "font": "Geist",                      // presetting the font
    "all-components": false,              // auto-install all on `bunx @catalystsoftware/ui`
    "install-tailwind": true,             // install Tailwind dependencies
    "configure-tailwind": true,           // create and paste .css file
    "configure-tailwind.config": true,    // true, "ngin", or false
    "install-postcss": true,              // install PostCSS dependencies
    "configure-postcss": true,            // create postcss.config.js
    "css": "app/routes/styles/tailwind.css",  // CSS file location
    "components": "app/"                  // components folder location
}
```

### Config Options Explained

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `theme` | string | `"blue"` | Default theme color |
| `preset` | string | `"MODERN"` | Default preset style |
| `font` | string | `"Geist"` | Default font family |
| `all-components` | boolean | `false` | Auto-install all components when running `bunx @catalystsoftware/ui` |
| `install-tailwind` | boolean | `true` | Install Tailwind CSS and related dependencies |
| `configure-tailwind` | boolean | `true` | Create the tailwind.css file at specified location |
| `configure-tailwind.config` | boolean\|"ngin" | `true` | `true` for basic config, `"ngin"` for 18k presets, `false` for none |
| `install-postcss` | boolean | `true` | Install PostCSS dependencies |
| `configure-postcss` | boolean | `true` | Create postcss.config.js file |
| `css` | string | `"app/routes/styles/tailwind.css"` | Path and filename for tailwind.css |
| `components` | string | `"app/"` | Base directory for components folder |

### Auto-Install with Config

Once you have a config file with `"all-components": true`, simply run:

```bash
bunx @catalystsoftware/ui
```

This will automatically:
1. Install all components to your specified components directory
2. Install required dependencies (if enabled)
3. Configure Tailwind CSS (if enabled)
4. Configure PostCSS (if enabled)
5. Create utils file

No menu selection needed!

### Tailwind Setup

Catalyst UI includes pre-configured Tailwind setups:

**Standard Configuration:**
```bash
bunx @catalystsoftware/ui
# Select: Configure Tailwind + PostCSS
```

**Ngin Configuration** (18,000 presets):
```bash
bunx @catalystsoftware/ui
# Select: Configure with Ngin
```

Or set in config:
```jsonc
{
    "configure-tailwind.config": "ngin"
}
```

### Utils File

All installations automatically create a `components/catalyst-ui/utils/utils.ts` file with helper functions:
- `cn()` - Class name merger
- `focusInput` - Focus styles
- `focusRing` - Focus ring utilities
- `formatDate()` - Date formatting


## Requirements

- React 18+
- Tailwind CSS 3+
- Node.js 16+

### Utils File

All installations automatically create a `utils/utils.ts` file with helper functions:
- `cn()` - Class name merger
- `focusInput` - Focus styles
- `focusRing` - Focus ring utilities
- `formatDate()` - Date formatting

## Examples

### Installing a Button Component

```bash
bunx @catalystsoftware/ui button
```

This will:
1. Create `/components/catalyst-ui/primitives/button.tsx`
2. Install required dependencies (extracted from component imports)
3. Create `utils/utils.ts` if it doesn't exist

### Using the Button Component

```tsx
import { Button } from '~/components/catalyst-ui';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Button 
      variant="default"
      size="lg"
      onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}
    >
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

### Installing Multiple Components

```bash
bunx @catalystsoftware/ui
# Select: Select Components
# Choose from the list
```

## Component Import Paths

All components use the centralized import path:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, Dialog } from '~/components/catalyst-ui';
```

Or import directly from category folders:

```tsx
import { Button } from '~/components/catalyst-ui/primitives';
import { useTimer } from '~/components/catalyst-ui/hooks';
```

## Features

- **TypeScript First** - Full TypeScript support with type definitions

# Smart Prop Autocomplete

Pressing ctrl & spacebar while your cursor is inside the quotations of any props value will bring up an intellisense dropdown with the available prop values that can be assigned.

# Signature Help

# Hover Documentation

Whenever hovering over a components name a hovercard will appear with its relevant documentation, removing the need to ever visit the site again.

> [!NOTE] 
> There will be a few components that will have duplicate data within the hovercard. While it won't be an exact duplicate, they will however contain 2 sets of usage examples and props values. 
> This is due to the fact that prior to learning how to progmatically provide a solution through the vscode extension itself, which was accomplished very easily and with zero extra effort all the while it covers the entire inventory, I was manually coding it into the source code of each and every single component. 
> At this time I don't remember how I came across the vscode implementation because I wasn't able to test it for a while after coding it, but however it came to be... thank-you, lol. 
> As you have saved me from manually writing it for 2500+ components which... would have sucked to say the least.

# Auto Import

To auto import the component right click the components name where ever it may be used within the editor, select `Add Import` in the editor context menu. 

# Go To Definition

Using cmd & ctrl & clicking the components name will bring up the source codes file in a, sheet style dropdown? I don't what what you call this really, any how, it allows you to view the source code file without navigating to it, while at the same time double clicking anywhere inside the "dropdown sheet" will navigate you to the source code file itself.

# Missing Import Warnings

Using the UI libraries inventory data, vscode will warn when not importing the component within any given file and should properly import from the correct location despite any other library installed that uses the same naming convention.

# In Editor Comp Autocomplete

Whenever you start to code a component `<`, pressing ctrl & spacebar will bring up the intellisense dropdown containing every single component currently available in the library, all 2500+.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As far as you or I using the components library, I beleive the above mentioned features finally completes all the goals I set out in regards to the UI library and delivering the absolute best DX... possible.
>
> 1. Accessibility to any component without visiting the site - Acheived through the editor and quick pick menus that inserts the relevant usage example right into the editor
> 2. Shorten the length to mastery - Achieved but still on going, as this is more done so on the side of the actual components them selves. There are many faucets to this goal some examples include, removing as many required props as possible, where ever possible in the case of tabs you do not have to supply a default tab value, or values for any of the tabs themselves, providing default values... literally anywhere, and every where that I could which also saves you from remembering from what is required whenever using a component.
> 3. Providing the easiest to use components - Achieved, to be honest I replicated and expanded upon the build processs of components that shadcn used. As they were the first library I had ever used that whenever you used a component, it not only made sense but each component was easy to use.
> 4. Remove as much friction as possible to install the components - This by far is better than any other single compnents library, anywhere. Using the npm library there are several options on what to install or if a components name is provided then installtion of that one component. To top it off, whenever you select options like full installation, it literally does EVERYTHING:
>   - installs all components
>   - installs all required libraries
>   - checks to see if tailwind is already installed, if not installs it
>   - configures tailwind and goes so far as configuring everything else needed to run tailwind
>   - creates tailwind.css
>   - depending on the selection you get a basic tailwind.config.ts or an extremely feature rich version of it, grating access to over 18,000 configrations that you can change your projects font, theme and preset ( padding, margins, etc )
>   - whenever a component is installed, whether it is the full installation or just a single component, it creates a new index file in the relevant locations so as you get to use `~/components/catalyst-ui` for literlly every single component no mattter the location
>   - just today I added, 'Configure Imports' which takes the previous item... a whole step further by configuring the tsconfig and package.json files so that all you have to do to import a component is `#catalyst` and if you use the icon library as well `#icons`. Now that I think of it, I've never ever... seen a dev or heard of one use this technique. I know as of late, a ton of devs are moving towards the @ in place of the tilde ( ~ ), to save typing the slash, but if your going to so far as to configuring your project so that you save typing a single character... why wouldn't you go the step further and do this? Since it saves you typing out a shit ton of characters... **shrugs**, anyways this feature is also trigger whenever you use full installation
>   - all in all, it provides a one clickesque solution for everything related to the library. I say one clickish, because it used to be such when it was implemented in the extension and only moved it to its own npm library to offer more variations for installation, but still it's just a single command. There isn't one other library that I know of that comes close to that... to my knowledge anyways. To this day, I beleive I have tried them all, that are react based anyways, as I will touch exactly why I tried them all in the next point.
> 5. Completely removing the need in having to 'need' more than one library - When trying to fulfill this goal, I was shocked at the current trend. The main larger libraries, it feels as if each one of them started with an idea that was either specialized or somewhat so and never really expanded upon once they reached that initial goal. Meanwhile, the lazy copy cats create an exact carbon copy of shadcn without adding anything of their own, or if they did or it was at first perceived that they did, it was one... maybe two items at most. Thus, each main library has massive holes in its offered inventory that leaves users... wanting / needing more. For example, the amount of hooks in this library, is unparallel to say the least, but there is only a single other library that can even be considered as coming close in terms of total hooks. While yes, the foundation of this libraries components used shadcn's but if you look at them today, you wouldn't be able to discern that fact. As each and every single one of them have been edited and expanded upon. Not to mention, a whole category, x, that no one else has, an entire animations category, a tool suite unlike any other I've ever seen, a ever growing blocks category in which I try to copy over any page that I code whenever I think of it, and to top it off unique reusable tools that if they aren't available yet they soon will be since they're on the to do list such as: 
>   - events calendar
>   - calendar
>   - automotive calculator
>   - messenger
>   - rich text editor - completely custom, unlike everyone else that wraps tiptap or some other library
>   - table - while the current iteration does wrap another library, it does however host features I have yet to see anywhere else in terms of ease of use and flexibility. Once I have the time... I do plan on creating my own table... but this I foresee taking... A LOT of time in doing it right
>   - and more... Currently, none of the others come to mind though
> There were several other goals but you get the point.
>
> Meanwhile, I was able to achieve something that I had NOT set out to do in regards to the X category. If you had asked me early on when I was first learning to code, do you think you would create a new method in creating react components? I would have not beleived you so much that, not only would I disregard it immediately but it would never cross my mind again to think about. Not only doing just that, but in a way that comes with all the benefits it does all the while at zero cost to the user when using it, didn't see that one coming. Today, I started to replace the main page of the theme builder and decided to use it as a... I wouldn't call it a proving grounds but a place to showcase the new category by giving each component a hover card with the code that was used to implement it. Besides saving a ton of space in terms of files ie, instead of having 100+ files devoted to different variants of inputs... it's just one. I noticed it also reduces a ton of code needed when actually implementing any one variation. So much so, that I will probably leave in the original section that I used, but edit so that each component comes with a hovercard with its implementation of code, so as you can see the difference.
>
> The other big plus I never saw coming, in terms of helping users ( despite still seeing devs still struggle with everything it solves ). Loki AI, as its now called, not only solves virtually every single issue you come across as a dev, and thats not an exageration, but have also cracked the limitation on being limited by an AI engines data training set. While The first point is already out and written about, the latter I'm still testing but the how to should be out soon. The weidest part about that is, getting these results uses methods that are already out there... just used differently.
>
> Knowing that all the goals have been completed... is satisfying. Especially given the fact that, this kinda sucked. Not so much from a coding perspective, but due to its size and with items to do such as providing hover card documentation for every single component... that sucks, but where ever I can and as much as I can I try to find ways to code it so that it takes care of itself. There have been so many days, where I thought I was going to be able to move on to something else only to find out after coming on... that no... there are things to be done with the ui library. Even now, there is still a massive update/change to severel large items that are held up in being pushed due to a couple of smaller other items, I just hope they don't need changes when I can finally test them in a prod enviroment.
>
> After typing this out, it had given me an idea by asking myself "Can we take it further?", it seems as though we can. Creating a new npm library called 'forge' it now acts as a cetralized CLI that grants access to all the libraries in one place along with, depending on the selected option, creating one command that install / updates the relevant libraries and packages. Creating a new remix run project, which will get replaced with a new creator soon, once the new project has been created it then installs icon and the ui library including installing, configuring all of tailwinds requirements and all the other smaller configuration goodies that come along with installing the library as well. I forgot to mention it even checks to see whether you have the vscode extension currently installed and at what version, prompting you to either update or installing it just like the other libraries. 
>
> Other than the create-remix2 replacement, I corrently do not see any other avenue in which it can be improved upon in terms of ux/dx.

What first started out as a simple markdown editor, it has since evolved into a full blown monaco editor with 150+ custom features with each feature making it become more and more a full blown ide. 

I have used this so much more than I ever thought I would and because of this it continues to receive regular updates. The largest update to date, is just about to be pushed to the site and will host a list of features so large I cannot remember them all to list but here are some of the features that will be available.

### Auto-Install with Config

Once you have a config file with `"all-components": true`, simply run:

```bash
bunx @catalystsoftware/ui
```

This will automatically:
1. Install all components to your specified components directory
2. Install required dependencies (if enabled)
3. Configure Tailwind CSS (if enabled)
4. Configure PostCSS (if enabled)
5. Create utils file

No menu selection needed!

### Tailwind Setup

Catalyst UI includes pre-configured Tailwind setups:

**Standard Configuration:**
```bash
bunx @catalystsoftware/ui
# Select: Configure Tailwind + PostCSS
```

**Ngin Configuration** (18,000 presets):
```bash
bunx @catalystsoftware/ui
# Select: Configure with Ngin
```

Or set in config:
```jsonc
{
    "configure-tailwind.config": "ngin"
}
```

### Utils File

All installations automatically create a `components/catalyst-ui/utils/utils.ts` file with helper functions:
- `cn()` - Class name merger
- `focusInput` - Focus styles
- `focusRing` - Focus ring utilities
- `formatDate()` - Date formatting


## Requirements

- React 18+
- Tailwind CSS 3+
- Node.js 16+

### Utils File

All installations automatically create a `utils/utils.ts` file with helper functions:
- `cn()` - Class name merger
- `focusInput` - Focus styles
- `focusRing` - Focus ring utilities
- `formatDate()` - Date formatting

## Examples

### Installing a Button Component

```bash
bunx @catalystsoftware/ui button
```

This will:
1. Create `/components/catalyst-ui/primitives/button.tsx`
2. Install required dependencies (extracted from component imports)
3. Create `utils/utils.ts` if it doesn't exist

### Using the Button Component

```tsx
import { Button } from '~/components/catalyst-ui';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Button 
      variant="default"
      size="lg"
      onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}
    >
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

### Installing Multiple Components

```bash
bunx @catalystsoftware/ui
# Select: Select Components
# Choose from the list
```

## Component Import Paths

All components use the centralized import path:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, Dialog } from '~/components/catalyst-ui';
```

Or import directly from category folders:

```tsx
import { Button } from '~/components/catalyst-ui/primitives';
import { useTimer } from '~/components/catalyst-ui/hooks';
```

## Features

- **TypeScript First** - Full TypeScript support with type definitions

## Dependencies

Components automatically install their required dependencies. Common dependencies include:
- `@radix-ui/react-*` - Primitive components
- `class-variance-authority` - Variant management
- `clsx` & `tailwind-merge` - Class name utilities
- `lucide-react` - Icons
- `framer-motion` - Animations (where applicable)

## File Structure

After installation, your project will have:

```
your-project/
├── components/
│   └── catalyst-ui/
│       ├── primitives/
│       ├── forms/
│       ├── overlays/
