> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This section of the docs needs to be rewritten again because of the below section. Till then you are free to use it, as its pretty straight forward despite the naming convention being changed from what github uses
> 
> Back in alpha again, if you have never used my projects before so as to not waste time I conduct testing as I code, once an issue crosses my path it gets fixed immediatly. Your more than welcome to use this, but if you come across an issue before I do, this is why
>
> The npm library has been let go as a means to serve this funtionality, moving it into the extension it self. The extension already deals with and will have a github token on hand to deal with your user account. In addition to remove anoter external tool/resource albeit my own, the performance... was something on the level of non-existant. Attempting to get the most out of it, there was much orange to squeeze as, it really wasn't a large app/library... no matter the context you gave it. Where as, similar commands triggered through the extension made it seem like the library was created 15 years ago.
>
> Not to mention, getting a ui this way and not having to bother remembering any cli command in its entirety as this will completely replace your use of github within vscode. 
>
> Another in addition to the above, while essentially recreating the library again from scratch, I went a couple of steps further in several ways to go that extra mile. Such as the config has been expanded upon, same name though:
>
> ```tsx
>    const configData = {
>      repo: 'newRepo',
>      owner: 'newOwner',
>      branch: 'newBranch',
>      private: 'isPrivate',
>      license: 'licensePick',
>      packageManager: 'packageManagerPick',
>      autoPushRepo: 'autoPushRepo',
>      baldr: 'baldr',
>      midgardr: 'midgardr',
>      midgardrLevel: "",
>      postcss: 'postcss',
>      tailwind: 'tailwind',
>      presetNgin: `presetNgin}`,
>      installPostInit: true,
>      readmeTemplate: readmeTemp || "none",
>      ensureBaseGitignore: true,
>      updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
>    }
> ```
>
>
> So all in all, took a long time to go around and land back at this point, lol. Despite trying to branch off and creating things outside this extension, this now being the fourth time this has happened, I guess I have finally learned my lesson in that... just make it here instead. Unless there is some massive downside, otherwise theres no point fighting against it anymore. There are literlly zero performance issues with the extension

    - asgard.git.conflict.resolve
      - The Pain: You try to combineTimelines or sync, and Git screams: "CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.js". The user is then left with those ugly <<<<<<< HEAD markers in their code. The Fix: resolveConflicts. Instead of leaving them to manually edit text, you can trigger the VS Code Merge Editor or provide a simple "Keep My Changes" vs. "Keep Their Changes" toggle.
    - .gitignore gaurdian ( executes silently )
      - The Pain: A user accidentally adds a 500MB node_modules folder or a .env file with secret keys and pushes it. Even if they delete it later, it’s stuck in the Git history forever, making the repo massive and insecure. The Fix: protectSecrets or cleanHistory. A command that scans for common "forbidden" files and offers to add them to .gitignore before the first saveProject happens.
    - asgard.git.timeline.repair
      - The Pain: Sometimes Git just breaks. You get an error saying index.lock exists, and you can't run any commands. Or you're in the middle of a "rebase" or "merge" and you don't know how to cancel it. The Fix: repairTimeline. A "Self-Heal" button that: Deletes index.lock. Runs git merge --abort or git rebase --abort. Cleans up dead processes.
    - asgard.git.timeline.emergency.splinter
      - The Pain: You’ve been coding for 2 hours on main before realizing, "Wait, this should have been a separate experiment!" Now you have to move your uncommitted work to a new branch without losing it. The Fix: moveWorkToNewTimeline. This stages your current work, creates a new branch, and resets main back to how it was, effectively "teleporting" your progress to a safe space.
    - asgard.project.install.offConfig
      - For users who want to skip everything and just create a new project based solely off of a config for a project in which you are already "standing" in, meaning you created a new empty folder and opened that folder in a new workspace and all you have it a config.asgard file in it. Allowing you to bypass all the prompts and all the other things. Because like most things once you go through it 4 or 5 times you will probably want a faster means in getting the job done but at the same level as if you went through all the prompts

### GitHub 

### Overview

This library is for you if one of the following is true:
1. finds github too complicated
2. hates memorizing or having to look up commands whenever you go to use git/github
3. can't remember the exact commands or flags needed to run git commands
4. no longer wants to use git but doesn't want to actually use another platform for whatever reason
5. new to development
6. tired of git/github
7. would like a resource that handles more than just github
8. and the list goes on...

While this resource works with more than just github as I have merged my other libraries in with this one, instead of have 9 resources which is dumb...

This resource is for anyone who has to continue using github but doesn't actually want to use it, or if your new to development. 

If your new to development, I urge you to use this library as it will save you from many headaches and time wasting excercises of dealing with github. It's a great platform and a great idea, they just really missed the mark when it comes to implementation and user experience. This is due to the fact that their naming conventions hold no meaning behind them for new people coming into the industry and the required commands to do anything you need to do... simply put, make no sense unless you either created the platform yourself or were one of the unlucky devs, like me, who had to bash their head against the wall in order to learn the platform.

For experienced devs, simply put, this will not only save you time but also save you from having to continue memorizing everything which will decrease the cognitive load of whenever you have to deal with github, which we use every day.

Either way as you can tell from the toc, the naming convention set forth by github has been replaced with a naming convention that not only makes sense but will actually hold meaning to you whether this is your first day or 10th year.

If this is your 10th year, the following breakdown will provide the conversions on the naming convention:
- project - is your local repo so anything project is referenced its refering to the local representation of your remote repo
- source - refers to remote, as it is the source of your project
- timeline - is your branch, timeline was chosen because whether you are new or not timeline immediatly tells someone that it can be temparay, can be deleted or can become the final project 
- version - replacing tags, this name immediatly conveys a versioning system where as tags... simply does not

To help with chaotic nature that is github and remove the fear of pushing or pulling of any one thing, a system has been put in place to ease and remove these burdens. If your new and have never used github, just skip this part as you do not need to know about this since the fear I'm talking about only plagues people who have used github.

The system that has been put in place is a custom sync sequence that happens before a lot of commands are actually executed, thus removing the pop up prompts like rejected push and other similar prompts telling you that your push or sync has failed. For example, whenever you use upload-project, aka git add *, git commit.. and so on, before running the actual push commands it will first pull/fetch/rebase, merge it with your local, and finally push the local to your repo. This ensures that before any action is taken, whatever branch your currently on, is always up to date so as you will never experience a conflit in refs or heads. If your skeptical about never to experience this again, I don't blame you but to ease this concern in one of my other projects I have an extension that contains a notes and to do app. Simple in nature I know but it uses github as a source of truth, which to be honest I have never seen another dev do before. The notes and to do files are accessible in every single workspace and I can have 4 workspaces open and use the extension in each of them whether or not their are dirty or clean notes in any number of them. This was made 9-10 months ago and not once have I ever had a rejected push. This project will receive the same treatment.

The reason I can ensure this, is because I too will be using this resource and do you think that I... want to deal with this crap day in and day out? No... lol, I do not. But before you ask, yes I'm making this entirely for myself and making public so I can access it everywhere. The only reason for the docs is because... I tend to build larger than normal resources, so large that at times I need to refer to my own documentation in order to remember how to use it, seriously. My vscode extension contains 175+ worth of extensions features and functionality. Currently I have 9 npm libraries, and right before creating this github wrapper I was looking at it and said to myself, "this is stupid, why am I creating so many?" and those libraries will be merged with this one. In addition to that, any other idea or need that comes up will also be added to this library. The only reason why I make the docs so descriptive as I don't need this much information in order to remember how to use it is because even in my last career I always went out of my way to help my colleagues and since I'm already making the documentation I might as well make it right so that anyone else can use it too.

The only libraries I plan on keeping up are the ones that have seen a lot of use considering, I have never told anyone about any of them, otherwise they will be removed once they have been merged



> [!NOTE] 
> Flags are not required and when left out it will prompt for the required information


### create-project

### With no arguments

```sh
asgard new-project
```

If you use the above command a series of prompts will be provided inquiring:
1. project name
2. which package manager you would like to use
3. license you would like to use
4. confirmation to pre install icons library
5. confirmation to pre install components library

Silently it will:
- create the new project folder
- cd into the project folder
- create readme.md
- create license.md
- create package.json
- create .env and .dev.env
- create .gitignore
- initialize github project
- create github repo
- push project to the new repo
- creates asgard.config with the provided values to be used later

Proving just how much easier life will become when using this resource, as this now perfectly sets you up to dive into whatever project you were planning on creating.

### With arguments

```sh
asgard new-project project-name
```

Obviously you may replace project-name with whatever you would like to call your project, doing this skips the prompt process with a set of defaults:
- icons: false
- ui components: false
- license: MIT
- branch: main
- package manger: pnpm

This command will follow the same processs as the previous.

### With config

```sh
asgard new-project
```

You may provide your own config with whatever values you would like by first creating the projects folder and then creating the config file 'config.asgard' and running the above command.

### Fallbacks

If you have never used github before or using it for the first time on this station there are a few command that will ensure that you have the required values in order to run everything and if you don't currently have them it will start off by asking you to provide username/owner, email and github token. This will trigger before running the following commands:

- create-project
- download-file
- download-folder
- download-source

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8an3/midgardr-notes/main/utils/vulknut.png" width="32"  style="vertical-align: middle; margin-bottom: 4px;"> Pro7 Archiver

Create password-encrypted archives containing sensitive files for safe inclusion in your GitHub repository

**Access Options:**
- DevStack Quick Pick menu
- Automatically runs in `G4 & .vsix` workflow
- Custom command sequences (concurrent/sequential objects)

**How It Works:**

1. **Configuration Scan:**
   - Scans workspace root for `.pro7` config file
   - If found: collects files specified in `.pro7` (similar to `.gitignore` but for inclusion)
   - If not found: defaults to including `.env` file only

2. **Password Setup:**
   - Checks `.env` file for `PRO7_PASSWORD` value
   - If not found: prompts for password input
   - Uses password to encrypt archive

3. **Archive Creation:**
   - Creates password-protected `.7z` archive
   - Places archive in workspace root
   - Updates archive automatically with latest changes

4. **Integration:**
   - Runs automatically in `G4 & .vsix` workflow
   - Ensures archive is up-to-date before GitHub push
   - Zero extra effort required

**`.pro7` Configuration Example:**

```
.env
.secrets.env
config/
secrets/
*.key
*.pem
api-keys.json
```

**Custom Command Integration:**

To include Pro7 Archiver in custom command sequences:

```json
{
  "label": "Your Label",
  "type": "command",
  "path": "ocrmnavigator.pro7.acrhive",
  "hidden": true
}
```

**Alternative: Standalone Script**

If the extension version doesn't work reliably, use the standalone script approach:

1. Place `pro7.js` in your autorun folder
2. Set extension setting to false: `"ocrmnavigator.PRO7": false`
3. Script runs separately from other autorun scripts

**Why Separate Script?** Microsoft's antivirus checks flag password-protected archives within `.vsix` files, causing potential issues.
