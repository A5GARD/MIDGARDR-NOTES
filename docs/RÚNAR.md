> Despite just recieving the largest update since it was created, I have decided in moving ahead with having github as the source of truth for snippets. 
> 
> Each snippet will be contained within its own file, and will allow for users to organize snippets using a folder structure. 
> 
> Not only does this move the storage and complete control to the user but also grants access to all the  benefits that github offers in terms of its platform. 
> 
> There will be no loss in features with this move, and because a part of the extension already does exactly this with 0 errors for... I can't remember the last time I had an error. 
> All the while I absolutely hammer that part of the extension, so much so that I have hit my weekly limits or monthly I can't remember. 
> 
> I haven't decided yet if I will use the workspace .vscode folder to store the local repo or just store it where snippets are currently being stored globally. 
> 
> This descision also extends to devarchive as it fits that philosophy extremely well, whenever I get the chance to start that idea. Currently the idea around that is snippets meets github, but more user friendly, where you can store any and all data aside from images and videos. That would be accessible via vscode, github, web, mobile etc. 
>
> Despite my feelings for github, it fits the need that devarchive has in terms of the whole idea behind it. Personally, I'd rather just code my own version of github and not have to deal with it again... but it then falls back to, the owner ultimately being the caretaker of data and if the owner goes, so does your data. While I have no intention on such an event and the service will be created in such a way that if I were to HAVE to pass it along and its responsibilities that it wouldn't be a chore in any sense, other than making sure the credit card that pays for hosting doesn't expire. That way, atleast it can continue living on instead of just... dying like so many resources right now, and I beleive that we are just on the cusp of witnessing a lot more of that.

Workspace context snippet system built with Monaco editor for creating, editing, and viewing snippets

- Snippets are stored on a global and workspace level, enabling workspace context snippets
- follows inline with the current context system that has worked flawlessly 
- in the extensions explorer pane, snippet items now auto generate, populating the SNIPPETS folder so you no longer have to manually create items for snippets
- each snippet tooltip will feature the entire body of the snippet for review
- left clicking on any item will place that snippets body, into your clipboard
- customize snippet icons with any of vscodes 520+ available icons

**Editor Access:** Extensions title pane or navigate straight to the web GUI

**Features:**
- Full Monaco editor integration - offering a wide breadth of features you have already become familiar with through the vscode editor interface
- Create and edit snippets with syntax highlighting
- View all snippets in one place
- Fuzzy search capabilities
- Quick insertion workflow
- Automatic workspace synchronization
- automated item generation with the virtual filing system
- copies to clipboard whenever an snippet item is clicked
- incorporated a series of functions into the monaco editor interface to allow an end-user to edit / create snippets, extremely fast in comparison to vscodes implementation
  - `alt + n` creates a new snippet
  - at the time of using the above shortcut, whatever contents are currently in your clipboard automatically get pasted into the snippets body
  - automated prefix building via the snippet label ( that can be disabled )
    - whatever human readable value placed in the label, converts it so each capital becomes lower case and each space becomes an underscore in place of the typical dash ( allowing for a lot quicker process to copy the label into your clipboard, as the double mouse click selection process gets halted by dashses )
  - before saving, if a folder is selected, the save process not only saves the snippet BUT also creates a new snippet item to be placed in your devstack config that will be used within the virtual filing system
  - the web interface consists of a command ( to search, using fuse.js, and view as a scrollable list that does NOT reset to the first snippet once one is selected to view / edit ) and a monaco editor


> [!TIP] Remote access for viewing / editing / downloading / sharing
> Previously, whenever you use the web ui a workspace has to be currently open in your vscode instance in order for the web ui to communicate with it to view, save data on a workspace or global level.
>
> With the implementation of user profiles on the web ui, you can now login to view, edit and download your snippets, DevStack configuration and `to do, notes and reminders` all from the site. Allowing users easier to much more easily share and update different workspaces. 
>
> For example, if you wanted to use the same DevStack configuration that you use at home, at work, you can now just log into the web ui via the title pane button, once logged in you will see a `sync to local` button on your profile dashboard which will download your config, snippets and your `to do, notes and reminders` settings to your currently used vscode instance.
>
> There will also be a download button, allowing you to download those same items to do with as you wish. 
>
> Alongside a `share` button, instead of downloading all of your data, it will only download what you wish to share via the checkboxes. The downloaded zip will only contain what you selected, if you just wish to share your config, you can. If you would just like to share your snippets with a friend, you can. Or maybe you need to share the to do items with a colleague.

### Key Differentiators

### DevStack's Unique Advantages
1. **Remote Access Infrastructure**: Web UI with user profiles for viewing, editing, and downloading from anywhere
2. **Account-Agnostic Sync**: Sync to any VSCode instance without requiring same login (work vs personal email)
3. **Workflow Automation**: `alt + n` with auto-clipboard paste, smart prefix generation
4. **Virtual Filing System**: Automatic item generation eliminating manual setup
5. **Clipboard-First Design**: Every click copies to clipboard automatically
6. **Full Body Tooltips**: See entire snippet without opening
7. **Selective Sharing**: Choose exactly what to share (config/snippets/to-dos)


## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8an3/midgardr-notes/main/utils/vulknut.png" width="32"  style="vertical-align: middle; margin-bottom: 4px;"> Context Snippets

One of the fundamental problems with snippet systems is prefix recall - you create a snippet with a prefix three months ago, and when you need it, you can't remember what you called it. At that point, IntelliSense becomes useless, and you're forced to open your snippet manager, search for the snippet, find the prefix, navigate back to your editor, and then type it in. Or you just give up and write the code manually.
DevStack solves this with Context Snippets: a searchable quick pick accessible directly from your editor's context menu.
Access: Right-click → DevStack → Context Snippets
Features:

**Access:** Right-click → DevStack → Context Snippets

- Instant access to all your snippets without leaving the editor
- Search by name or scroll through the complete list
- Select and insert immediately - no prefix required
- IntelliSense still works perfectly when you remember prefixes
- Prefixes become optional convenience instead of required knowledge

Context Snippets transforms the snippet workflow from "hoping you remember the right prefix" to "always having instant access to exactly what you need." No navigation, no searching through files, no interruption to your coding flow.
