- [ ] starting v2 fuck
- [ ] Option B: Extension-Based Snippets (The "Pro" Way)
Since you mentioned building a VS Code Extension in your philosophy, you can use the vscode.TextEditorEdit API. This allows you to literally teleport code to the top of the file while dropping code at the cursor.

Here is a simplified logic for your extension:

JavaScript

// Inside your extension command
editor.edit(editBuilder => {
    // 1. Insert the import at the very top (0, 0)
    editBuilder.insert(new vscode.Position(0, 0), "import { Input } from '#midgardr/Input';\n");

    // 2. Insert the usage at the current cursor position
    editBuilder.insert(editor.selection.active, "<Input $0 />");
});
- [x] make sure termiunal grixd is getting assigned to the correct col
- [x] remove format on paste in monaco editor
- [x] finish off renaming functions -> `ocrmnavigator.addCategory` -> `ocrmnavigator.master.addCategory`
- [ ] ### Need to implement function on / off switches for:
- [ ] need to implement `ocrmnavigator.vfs.tasks`
- [ ] need to implement `ocrmnavigator.vfs.npmScripts`
- [ ] need to implement `ocrmnavigator.todoNotesReminders`
- [ ] need to implement `ocrmnavigator.codesnap.backgroundPalette` and others


- [ ] ★ ━━━━ ☆ ━━━━     NEW FEATURES     ━━━━ ☆ ━━━━ ★

- [ ] ★ ━━━━ ☆ ━━━━     PLANNED     ━━━━ ☆ ━━━━ ★
  - [ ] ★ ━━━━ REMOTE ACCESS / EDITING ━━━━ ★
    - [ ] access to:
    - [ ] config
    - [ ] snippets
    - [ ] todo, notes and reminders
    - [ ] be able to download your config from anywhere
    - [ ] set up user profile on site
    - [ ] user github email for syncing data

  - [ ] ★ ━━━━ COPY WORKSPACE FOLDER ━━━━ ★ 
    - [ ] to make it even easier to configure new / existing configs
    - [ ] provid a list of folders contained within other configs once clicked pastes it into the current configs file

  - [ ] ★ ━━━━ THE "LOG-TO-LENS" ( ERROR PARSER ) ━━━━ ★
    - [ ] The Pain: Your build failed or your test crashed. The terminal is a wall of 500 lines of red text. You have to scroll up, find the file path in the stack trace, copy it, Ctrl+P, and paste the path to fix the bug.
    - [ ] The Fix: An extractFileFromOutput type.
    - [ ] How it works: It scans the last output of the integrated terminal for file paths and line numbers. It then populates the Navigator with "Jump to Last Error" items.
    - [ ] Time Saved: 90%. You click the Navigator item instead of manually parsing the terminal's "wall of text."

  - [ ] ★ ━━━━ PROXY TUNNEL TOGGLE ( PORT MANAGER ) ━━━━ ★
    - [ ] The Pain: You’re working on a mobile app or an external API that needs to see your local server. You have to open a separate terminal, remember your ngrok or localtonet command, copy the new URL, and paste it into your config.
    - [ ] Value: It automates the "copy-paste" loop between the terminal and your code.
    - [ ] The Workflow: A specialized command that launches a tunnel (like ngrok http 3000), captures the generated URL, and automatically updates a specific line in your config.ts or .env with the new public URL.
    - [ ] The Fix: A tunnelLauncher type.

  - [ ] ★ ━━━━ FEATURE REQUEST QUICK PICK ━━━━ ★
    - [ ] query current user base via a toast on load up, once clicked opens a vscode quick pick with current feautres to pick, once they select a value they are then presented an input to supply their own feature request
  - [ ] ★ ━━━━ API SECRET GRABBER ( VAULT FETCH) ━━━━ ★
    - [ ] The Pain: You need a staging/prod API key that isn't in your local .env for security reasons. You have to log into AWS Secrets Manager, 1Password, or your company Wiki, find the key, and copy it.
    - [ ] The Fix: A type that fetches a value from a CLI-based vault (like gh secret, aws secretsmanager, or a local encrypted file).
    - [ ] How it works: It executes the CLI fetch and uses your existing copyToClipboard logic to put the secret in your hand instantly.
    - [ ] Value: Huge security and speed boost. No more "hunting for the wiki page."
  - [ ] dependencyManager 
    - [ ] Install/uninstall/update multiple npm packages in one click with predefined sets (ie "React setup" installs react, react-dom, types in one go vs typing each npm install command)
  - [ ] ★ ━━━━ ☆ ━━━━     VISUALIZE SCHEMA OBJECT     ━━━━ ☆ ━━━━ ★
  - [ ] start from scratch and build it on the browser side
  - [ ] within the web app, build a schema wizard. I find that as the schema / project continues to build and expanded on I'm constantly jumping back and forth, from object to object, grabing the value to link to another object, then going back ensuring everything was done right, then triple checking. All the while, your bouncing down 450 lines, then back up 450, then down 550, shit went to far... searching for it again, saying under my breath, where the fuck did it just go... lol
  - [ ] whenever working with an object, have a + relation button, when clicked opens a command to search and select a object to link to
  - [ ] being able to insert pre built objects
  - [ ] with nice, thought-out and planned ui, would make it so easy to work with, like having a command on the left to search for or select the object to edit, this object should be linked, so editing the user object needing to add that relation, technically, you can remove half that processes work laod. Steps to complete would be: 1) select user object, 2) click add relation, and select review object
  - [ ] ★ ━━━━ ☆ ━━━━     DEVARCHIVE     ━━━━ ☆ ━━━━ ★
    - [ ] I’ve noticed a disturbing trend: the "Great Deleting." The people who built the web are retiring or passing on, and their servers are going dark. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve needed a specific resource only to find the site no longer exists.
    - [ ] I’m building DevArchive because I’m tired of watching knowledge disappear. I’m building it for myself, but I’m opening it to everyone.
    - [ ] The "Hit by a Bus" Philosophy Most platforms require constant human intervention. DevArchive is different. It is being built to require virtually zero man-hours to maintain. Whether I get sick for a year or pass the torch 50 years from now, this system is designed to be a self-sustaining utility, not a chore for the next person.
    - [ ] What it is: A home for your code, your docs, and your research. What it isn't: A host for images or video (the costs are simply too high for now).
    - [ ] This is a place where data survives. Whether you want to share your knowledge with the world or keep it private, you can finally rely on the "Save" button again.

  - [ ] ★ ━━━━ CONDITIONAL CHAIN ━━━━ ★
    - [ ] conditionalChain: Logic-based execution. 
    - [ ] Utility: Run Command A; if it succeeds, run Command B; if it fails, run Command C. (This adds a "Scripting" layer to the NavigatorItem).
  - [x] focusMode: A specialized toggle.Utility: Toggles Zen Mode, hides the Sidebar, and hides the Activity Bar all in one click to help with deep work
  - [x] fix add item via web 
  - [x] to do list: code highlighting
  - [x] need to add item type to add currenty worksapces devstack setting as a file item
  - [x] need to add quickpick engine
  - [x] add editor highlighting to todo
  - [x] need to update snippet editor

  - [x] the layout engine with 3 cols... when its finished, all three columns are focused at the same time. meaning you have to click each cols editors in order to drop the "focused" state in each. we need to progmatically drop focus and refocus the 2nd col
  - [x] rename batch fell through the cracks as it seems we are still running off of the other extension
  - [x] in the catalyst editor we need to make sure if you are currently in a stylized note or important or warning, that the editor automatically put `>` whenever you press enter to continue the note
  - [ ] ★ ━━━━ ☆ ━━━━     README.md     ━━━━ ☆ ━━━━ ★
    - [x] terminal engine... currently if there is currently a daev serverv nothing will run... we need to check and see if the current terminal window is busy... if it is creater a new window HL:src\helpers\master.ts:330-371
    - [X] ★ ━━━━ MOVE ITEM ━━━━ ★
    - [x] opens a quick pick with that folders items, when an item is clicked on it takes the item ur moving and places it ontop of the item you clicked on, same as when you go to cut an entire line in vscode and paste it, it places it ontop of the line you placed ur cursor on
